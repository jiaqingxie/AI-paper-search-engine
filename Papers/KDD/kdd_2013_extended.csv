The default now is to capture and store any and all data, in anticipation of potential future strategic value, and vast amounts of data are being generated by instrumenting key customer and systems touch points. Until recently, data was gathered for well-defined objectives such as auditing, forensics, reporting and line-of-business operations; now, exploratory and predictive analysis is becoming ubiquitous. These differences in data heterogeneity, scale and usage are leading to a new generation of data management and analytic systems, where the emphasis is on supporting a wide range of large datasets to be stored uniformly and analyzed seamlessly using whatever techniques are most appropriate, including traditional tools like SQL and BI and newer tools, e.g., for machine learning. These new systems are necessarily based on scale-out architectures for both storage and computation. The terms Big Data and data science are often used to refer to this class of systems and applications.",0

Together, these three courses had enrollments of around 350,000 students, making this one of the largest experiments in online education ever performed. Since the beginning of 2012, we have transitioned this effort into a new venture, Coursera, a social entrepreneurship company whose mission is to make high-quality education accessible to everyone by allowing the best universities to offer courses to everyone around the world, for free. Coursera classes provide a real course experience to students, including video content, interactive exercises with meaningful feedback, using both auto-grading and peer-grading, and a rich peer-to-peer interaction around the course materials. Currently, Coursera has 62 university partners, and over 3 million students enrolled in its over 300 courses. These courses span a range of topics including computer science, business, medicine, science, humanities, social sciences, and more. In this talk, I'll report on this far-reaching experiment in education, and why we believe this model can provide both an improved classroom experience for our on-campus students, via a flipped classroom model, as well as a meaningful learning experience for the millions of students around the world who would otherwise never have access to education of this quality.",30

The optimization perspective has provided valuable insights, and optimization formulations have led to practical algorithms with good theoretical properties. In turn, the rich collection of problems in learning and data analysis is providing fresh perspectives on optimization algorithms and is driving new fundamental research in the area. We discuss research on several areas in this domain, including signal reconstruction, manifold learning, and regression/classification, describing in each case recent research in which optimization algorithms have been developed and applied successfully. A particular focus is asynchronous parallel algorithms for optimization and linear algebra, and their applications in data analysis and learning.",26

A variety of heuristic adjustments to these models have been proposed, many of which are based on the use of context information to improve the performance of topic modeling. Existing contextualized topic models rely on arbitrary manipulation of the model structure, by incorporating various context variables into the generative process of classical topic models in an ad hoc manner. Such manipulations usually result in much more complicated model structures, sophisticated inference procedures, and low generalizability to accommodate arbitrary types or combinations of contexts. In this paper we explore a different direction. We propose a general solution that is able to exploit multiple types of contexts without arbitrary manipulation of the structure of classical topic models. We formulate different types of contexts as multiple views of the partition of the corpus. A co-regularization framework is proposed to let these views collaborate with each other, vote for the consensus topics, and distinguish them from view-specific topics. Experiments with real-world datasets prove that the proposed method is both effective and flexible to handle arbitrary types of contexts.",61

Fox, Carlos Guestrin, ","From Twitter to Facebook to Reddit, users have become accustomed to sharing the articles they read with friends or followers on their social networks. While previous work has modeled what these shared stories say about the user who shares them, the converse question remains unexplored: what can we learn about an article from the identities of its likely readers? To address this question, we model the content of news articles and blog posts by attributes of the people who are likely to share them. For example, many Twitter users describe themselves in a short profile, labeling themselves with phrases such as ""vegetarian"" or ""liberal."" By assuming that a user's labels correspond to topics in the articles he shares, we can learn a labeled dictionary from a training corpus of articles shared on Twitter. Thereafter, we can code any new document as a sparse non-negative linear combination of user labels, where we encourage correlated labels to appear together in the output via a structured sparsity penalty.",26

However, there has been relatively little work on measuring the diversity of text documents via their content. In this paper we present a text-based framework for quantifying how diverse a document is in terms of its content. The proposed approach learns a topic model over a corpus of documents, and computes a distance matrix between pairs of topics using measures such as topic co-occurrence. These pairwise distance measures are then combined with the distribution of topics within a document to estimate each document's diversity relative to the rest of the corpus. The method provides several advantages over existing methods. It is fully data-driven, requiring only the text from a corpus of documents as input, it produces human-readable explanations, and it can be generalized to score diversity of other entities such as authors, academic departments, or journals. We describe experimental results on several large data sets which suggest that the approach is effective and accurate in quantifying how diverse a document is relative to other documents in a corpus.",48

Mirrokni, Mayur Thakur, ","Aggregator websites typically present documents in the form of representative clusters. In order for users to get a broader perspective, it is important to deliver a diversified set of representative documents in those clusters. One approach to diversification is to maximize the average dissimilarity among documents. Another way to capture diversity is to avoid showing several documents from the same category (e.g. from the same news channel). We combine the above two diversification concepts by modeling the latter approach as a (partition) matroid constraint, and study diversity maximization problems under matroid constraints. We present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for this problem, using a new technique. Our local search 0.5-approximation algorithm is also the first constant-factor approximation for the max-dispersion problem under matroid constraints. Our combinatorial proof technique for maximizing diversity under matroid constraints uses the existence of a family of Latin squares which may also be of independent interest.",80

The information on an individual site is often incomplete. When sources of complementary information are integrated, a better profile of a user can be built to improve online services such as verifying online information. To integrate these sources of information, it is necessary to identify individuals across social media sites. This paper aims to address the cross-media user identification problem. We introduce a methodology (MOBIUS) for finding a mapping among identities of individuals across social media sites. It consists of three key components: the first component identifies users' unique behavioral patterns that lead to information redundancies across sites; the second component constructs features that exploit information redundancies due to these behavioral patterns; and the third component employs machine learning for effective user identification. We formally define the cross-media user identification problem and show that MOBIUS is effective in identifying users across social media sites. This study paves the way for analysis and mining across social media sites, and facilitates the creation of novel online services across sites.",405

Given that the number of responses to an online news article may be huge, a common challenge is that of selecting only the most interesting responses for display. This paper addresses this challenge by casting message selection as an optimization problem. We define an objective function which jointly models the messages' utility scores and their entropy. We propose a near-optimal solution to the underlying optimization problem, which leverages the submodularity property of the objective function. Our solution first learns the utility of individual messages in isolation and then produces a diverse selection of interesting messages by maximizing the defined objective function. The intuitions behind our work are that an interesting selection of messages contains diverse, informative, opinionated and popular messages referring to the news article, written mostly by users that have authority on the topic. Our intuitions are embodied by a rich set of content, social and user features capturing the aforementioned aspects. We evaluate our approach through both human and automatic experiments, and demonstrate it outperforms the state of the art. Additionally, we perform an in-depth analysis of the annotated ``interesting'' responses, shedding light on the subjectivity around the selection process and the perception of interestingness.",52

Although much work has been done to identify socially influential users, the problem of finding ""reputable"" sharers, who share good content, has received relatively little attention. Availability of such reputation scores can be useful or various applications like recommending people to follow, procuring high quality content in a scalable way, creating a content reputation economy to incentivize high quality sharing, and many more. To estimate sharer reputation, it is intuitive to leverage data that records how recipients respond (through clicking, liking, etc.) to content items shared by a sharer. However, such data is usually biased --- it has a selection bias since the shared items can only be seen and responded to by users connected to the sharer in most social networks, and it has a response bias since the response is usually influenced by the relationship between the sharer and the recipient (which may not indicate whether the shared content is good). To correct for such biases, we propose to utilize an additional data source that provides unbiased goodness estimates for a small set of shared items, and calibrate biased social data through a novel multi-level hierarchical model that describes how the unbiased data and biased data are jointly generated according to sharer reputation scores. The unbiased data also provides the ground truth for quantitative evaluation of different methods. Experiments based on such ground-truth data show that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods that estimate social influence using biased social data.",8

The task to link the named entity mentions detected from tweets with the corresponding real world entities in the knowledge base is called tweet entity linking. This task is of practical importance and can facilitate many different tasks, such as personalized recommendation and user interest discovery. The tweet entity linking task is challenging due to the noisy, short, and informal nature of tweets. Previous methods focus on linking entities in Web documents, and largely rely on the context around the entity mention and the topical coherence between entities in the document. However, these methods cannot be effectively applied to the tweet entity linking task due to the insufficient context information contained in a tweet. In this paper, we propose KAURI, a graph-based framework to collectively link all the named entity mentions in all tweets posted by a user via modeling the user's topics of interest. Our assumption is that each user has an underlying topic interest distribution over various named entities. KAURI integrates the intra-tweet local information with the inter-tweet user interest information into a unified graph-based framework. We extensively evaluated the performance of KAURI over manually annotated tweet corpus, and the experimental results show that KAURI significantly outperforms the baseline methods in terms of accuracy, and KAURI is efficient and scales well to tweet stream.",185

Many real applications in various fields require efficient and effective management of large-scale graph structured data. Although distributed graph engines such as GBase and Pregel handle billion-scale graphs, the user needs to be skilled at managing and tuning a distributed system in a cluster, which is a nontrivial job for the ordinary user. Furthermore, these distributed systems need many machines in a cluster in order to provide reasonable performance. In order to address this problem, a disk-based parallel graph engine called Graph-Chi, has been recently proposed. Although Graph-Chi significantly outperforms all representative (disk-based) distributed graph engines, we observe that Graph-Chi still has serious performance problems for many important types of graph queries due to 1) limited parallelism and 2) separate steps for I/O processing and CPU processing. In this paper, we propose a general, disk-based graph engine called TurboGraph to process billion-scale graphs very efficiently by using modern hardware on a single PC. TurboGraph is the first truly parallel graph engine that exploits 1) full parallelism including multi-core parallelism and FlashSSD IO parallelism and 2) full overlap of CPU processing and I/O processing as much as possible. Specifically, we propose a novel parallel execution model, called pin-and-slide. TurboGraph also provides engine-level operators such as BFS which are implemented under the pin-and-slide model. Extensive experimental results with large real datasets show that TurboGraph consistently and significantly outperforms Graph-Chi by up to four orders of magnitude! Our implementation of TurboGraph is available at ``http://wshan.net/turbograph}"" as executable files.",263

This modular setup allows re-use of components across several different pipelines. However, the interaction of independently tuned pipeline components yields poor end-to-end performance as errors introduced by one component cascade through the whole pipeline, affecting overall accuracy. We propose a novel model for reasoning across components of Big Data Pipelines in a probabilistically well-founded manner. Our key idea is to view the interaction of components as dependencies on an underlying graphical model. Different message passing schemes on this graphical model provide various inference algorithms to trade-off end-to-end performance and computational cost. We instantiate our framework with an efficient beam search algorithm, and demonstrate its efficiency on two Big Data Pipelines: parsing and relation extraction.",16

By co-designing all of these elements we achieve single-machine performance levels that equal or exceed reported cluster implementations for common benchmark problems. A key design criterion is rapid exploration of models, hence the system is interactive and primarily single-user. The elements of the suite are: (i) the data engine, a hardware design pattern that balances storage, CPU and GPU acceleration for typical data mining workloads, (ii) BIDMat, an interactive matrix library that integrates CPU and GPU acceleration and novel computational kernels (iii), BIDMach, a machine learning system that includes very efficient model optimizers, (iv) Butterfly mixing, a communication strategy that hides the latency of frequent model updates needed by fast optimizers and (v) Design patterns to improve performance of iterative update algorithms. We present several benchmark problems to show how the above elements combine to yield multiple orders-of-magnitude improvements for each problem.",77

Given that the direct optimization of edge density is not meaningful, as even a single edge achieves maximum density, research has focused on optimizing alternative density functions.

Surprisingly enough, however, densest subgraphs are typically large graphs, with small edge density and large diameter.",260

In contrast to community discovery, which finds groups of highly connected nodes, role discovery finds groups of nodes that share similar topological structure in the graph, and hence a common role (or function) such as being a broker or a periphery node. However, existing work so far is completely unsupervised, which is undesirable for a number of reasons. We provide an alternating least squares framework that allows convex constraints to be placed on the role discovery problem, which can provide useful supervision. In particular we explore supervision to enforce i) sparsity, ii) diversity, and iii) alternativeness in the roles. We illustrate the usefulness of this supervision on various data sets and applications.",77

Furthermore, their results are often undesirable as many of the returned maximal cliques have large overlapping parts.

The goal of selective sampling is to achieve a good trade-off between prediction performance and the number of queried labels. Existing selective sampling algorithms are designed for vector-based data. In this paper, motivated by the ubiquity of graph representations in real-world applications, we propose to study selective sampling on graphs. We first present an online version of the well-known Learning with Local and Global Consistency method (OLLGC). It is essentially a second-order online learning algorithm, and can be seen as an online ridge regression in the Hilbert space of functions defined on graphs. We prove its regret bound in terms of the structural property (cut size) of a graph. Based on OLLGC, we present a selective sampling algorithm, namely Selective Sampling with Local and Global Consistency (SSLGC), which queries the label of each node based on the confidence of the linear function on graphs. Its bound on the label complexity is also derived. We analyze the low-rank approximation of graph kernels, which enables the online algorithms scale to large graphs. Experiments on benchmark graph datasets show that OLLGC outperforms the state-of-the-art first-order algorithm significantly, and SSLGC achieves comparable or even better results than OLLGC while querying substantially fewer nodes. Moreover, SSLGC is overwhelmingly better than random sampling.",33

The main idea is to map the data to a feature space based on kernel density estimation. A discriminative model is then learned to optimize the feature weights as well as the bandwidth of a Nadaraya-Watson kernel density estimator. We then propose a hierarchical optimization algorithm for learning the coefficients and kernel bandwidths in an integrated way. Compared to other nonlinear models such as kernel logistic regression (KLR) and SVM, our approach is far more efficient since it solves an optimization problem with a much smaller size. Two other major advantages are that it can cope with categorical attributes in a unified fashion and naturally handle multi-class problems. Moveover, our approach inherits from logistic regression good interpretability of the model, which is important for clinical applications but not offered by KLR and SVM. Extensive results on real datasets, including a clinical prediction application currently under deployment in a major hospital, show that our approach not only achieves superior classification accuracy, but also drastically reduces the computing time as compared to other leading methods.",25

Most of the current MIL methods only deal with the case when each instance is represented by one type of features. However, in many real world applications, entities are often described from several different information sources/views. For example, when applying MIL to image categorization, the characteristics of each image can be derived from both its RGB features and SIFT features. Previous research work has shown that, in traditional learning methods, leveraging the consistencies between different information sources could improve the classification performance drastically.",33
kdd,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2487575.2487643,Querying discriminative and representative samples for batch mode active learning,"Zheng Wang, Jieping Ye, ","Empirical risk minimization (ERM) provides a useful guideline for many machine learning and data mining algorithms. Under the ERM principle, one minimizes an upper bound of the true risk, which is approximated by the summation of empirical risk and the complexity of the candidate classifier class. To guarantee a satisfactory learning performance, ERM requires that the training data are i.i.d. sampled from the unknown source distribution. However, this may not be the case in active learning, where one selects the most informative samples to label and these data may not follow the source distribution. In this paper, we generalize the empirical risk minimization principle to the active learning setting. We derive a novel form of upper bound for the true risk in the active learning setting; by minimizing this upper bound we develop a practical batch mode active learning method. The proposed formulation involves a non-convex integer programming optimization problem. We solve it efficiently by an alternating optimization method. Our method is shown to query the most informative samples while preserving the source distribution as much as possible, thus identifying the most uncertain and representative queries. Experiments on benchmark data sets and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.",132

In an increasing number of applications, however, ranging from ranking applications to a variety of important bioinformatics applications, performance is measured in terms of the partial area under the ROC curve between two specified false positive rates. In recent work, we proposed a structural SVM based approach for optimizing this performance measure (Narasimhan and Agarwal, 2013). In this paper, we develop a new support vector method, SVMpAUCtight, that optimizes a tighter convex upper bound on the partial AUC loss, which leads to both improved accuracy and reduced computational complexity. In particular, by rewriting the empirical partial AUC risk as a maximum over subsets of negative instances, we derive a new formulation, where a modified form of the earlier optimization objective is evaluated on each of these subsets, leading to a tighter hinge relaxation on the partial AUC loss. As with our previous method, the resulting optimization problem can be solved using a cutting-plane algorithm, but the new method has better run time guarantees. We also discuss a projected subgradient method for solving this problem, which offers additional computational savings in certain settings. We demonstrate on a wide variety of bioinformatics tasks, ranging from protein-protein interaction prediction to drug discovery tasks, that the proposed method does, in many cases, perform significantly better on the partial AUC measure than the previous structural SVM approach. In addition, we also develop extensions of our method to learn sparse and group sparse models, often of interest in biological applications.",49

Since rich information on various compound-protein inter- actions is available in recent molecular databases, strong demands for making best use of such databases require to in- vent powerful methods to help us find new functional compound-protein pairs on a large scale. We present the succinct interval-splitting tree algorithm (SITA) that efficiently per- forms similarity search in databases for compound-protein pairs with respect to both binary fingerprints and real-valued properties. SITA achieves both time and space efficiency by developing the data structure called interval-splitting trees, which enables to efficiently prune the useless portions of search space, and by incorporating the ideas behind wavelet tree, a succinct data structure to compactly represent trees. We experimentally test SITA on the ability to retrieve similar compound-protein pairs/substrate-product pairs for a query from large databases with over 200 million compound- protein pairs/substrate-product pairs and show that SITA performs better than other possible approaches.",4

Thompson, Jieping Ye, ","With the advances and increasing sophistication in data collection techniques, we are facing with large amounts of data collected from multiple heterogeneous sources in many applications. For example, in the study of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), different types of measurements such as neuroimages, gene/protein expression data, genetic data etc. are often collected and analyzed together for improved predictive power. It is believed that a joint learning of multiple data sources is beneficial as different data sources may contain complementary information, and feature-pruning and data source selection are critical for learning interpretable models from high-dimensional data. Very often the collected data comes with block-wise missing entries; for example, a patient without the MRI scan will have no information in the MRI data block, making his/her overall record incomplete. There has been a growing interest in the data mining community on expanding traditional techniques for single-source complete data analysis to the study of multi-source incomplete data. The key challenge is how to effectively integrate information from multiple heterogeneous sources in the presence of block-wise missing data. In this paper we first investigate the situation of complete data and present a unified ``bi-level"" learning model for multi-source data. Then we give a natural extension of this model to the more challenging case with incomplete data. Our major contributions are threefold: (1) the proposed models handle both feature-level and source-level analysis in a unified formulation and include several existing feature learning approaches as special cases; (2) the model for incomplete data avoids direct imputation of the missing elements and thus provides superior performances. Moreover, it can be easily generalized to other applications with block-wise missing data sources; (3) efficient optimization algorithms are presented for both the complete and incomplete models. We have performed comprehensive evaluations of the proposed models on the application of AD diagnosis. Our proposed models compare favorably against existing approaches.",68

Such problems naturally exist in fMRI scans of human subjects. These scans consist of activations of thousands of voxels over time with the aim to simplify them into the underlying cognitive network being used. We propose supervised and semi-supervised variations of this problem and postulate a constrained tensor decomposition formulation and a corresponding alternating least squares solver that is easy to implement. We show this formulation works well in controlled experiments where supervision is incomplete, superfluous and noisy and is able to recover the underlying ground truth network. We then show that for real fMRI data our approach can reproduce well known results in neurology regarding the default mode network in resting-state healthy and Alzheimer affected individuals. Finally, we show that the reconstruction error of the decomposition provides a useful measure of the network strength and is useful at predicting key cognitive scores both by itself and with clinical information.",102

Realizing that heterogeneous entities and relationships are also ubiquitous in the real world applications, there is an emerging need to retrieve and search similar or relevant data entities from multiple heterogeneous domains, e.g., recommending relevant posts and images to a certain Facebook user. In this paper, we address the problem of ``comparing apples to oranges'' under the large scale setting. Specifically, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Hashing (RaHH), which provides a general framework for generating hash codes of data entities sitting in multiple heterogeneous domains. Unlike some existing hashing methods that map heterogeneous data in a common Hamming space, the RaHH approach constructs a Hamming space for each type of data entities, and learns optimal mappings between them simultaneously. This makes the learned hash codes flexibly cope with the characteristics of different data domains. Moreover, the RaHH framework encodes both homogeneous and heterogeneous relationships between the data entities to design hash functions with improved accuracy. To validate the proposed RaHH method, we conduct extensive evaluations on two large datasets; one is crawled from a popular social media sites, Tencent Weibo, and the other is an open dataset of Flickr(NUS-WIDE). The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the RaHH outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing methods with significant performance gains.",69

In particular, we employ truncated loss function to induce a series of convex programs with superior dual sparsity, and solve each dual using Indexed Block Coordinate Descent, which makes use of Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search to select active dual variables without I/O cost on irrelevant samples. We prove that, despite the bias and weak guarantee from ANN query, the proposed algorithm has global convergence to the solution defined on entire dataset, with sublinear complexity each iteration.

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for discovering latent influence from sequences of item adoption events. An inhomogeneous Poisson process is used for modeling a sequence, in which adoption by a user triggers the subsequent adoption of the same item by other users. For modeling adoption of multiple items, we employ multiple inhomogeneous Poisson processes, which share parameters, such as influence for each user and relations between users. The proposed model can be used for finding influential users, discovering relations between users and predicting item popularity in the future.

How to accurately extract the low-rank and sparse components is a major challenge. Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) is a general framework to extract such structures. It is well studied that under certain assumptions, convex optimization using the trace norm and l1-norm can be an effective computation surrogate of the difficult RPCA problem. However, such convex formulation is based on a strong assumption which may not hold in real-world applications, and the approximation error in these convex relaxations often cannot be neglected. In this paper, we present a novel non-convex formulation for the RPCA problem using the capped trace norm and the capped l1-norm. In addition, we present two algorithms to solve the non-convex optimization: one is based on the Difference of Convex functions (DC) framework and the other attempts to solve the sub-problems via a greedy approach. Our empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world data show that both of the proposed algorithms achieve higher accuracy than existing convex formulations.

Each domain provides a different view of the data instances. Leveraging cross-domain information has been demonstrated an effective way to achieve better clustering results. Despite the previous success, existing multi-view graph clustering methods usually assume that different views are available for the same set of instances. Thus instances in different domains can be treated as having strict one-to-one relationship. In many real-life applications, however, data instances in one domain may correspond to multiple instances in another domain. Moreover, relationships between instances in different domains may be associated with weights based on prior (partial) knowledge. In this paper, we propose a flexible and robust framework, CGC (Co-regularized Graph Clustering), based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), to tackle these challenges. CGC has several advantages over the existing methods. First, it supports many-to-many cross-domain instance relationship. Second, it incorporates weight on cross-domain relationship. Third, it allows partial cross-domain mapping so that graphs in different domains may have different sizes. Finally, it provides users with the extent to which the cross-domain instance relationship violates the in-domain clustering structure, and thus enables users to re-evaluate the consistency of the relationship.

In this work, we propose a novel methodology using graph clustering to analyze average treatment effects under social interference. To begin, we characterize graph-theoretic conditions under which individuals can be considered to be `network exposed' to an experiment. We then show how graph cluster randomization admits an efficient exact algorithm to compute the probabilities for each vertex being network exposed under several of these exposure conditions.

First, we introduce a novel social influence based vertex similarity metric in terms of both self-influence similarity and co-influence similarity. We compute self-influence and co-influence based similarity based on social graph and its associated activity graphs and influence graphs respectively. Second, we compute the combined social influence based similarity between each pair of vertices by unifying the self-similarity and multiple co-influence similarity scores through a weight function with an iterative update method. Third, we design an iterative learning algorithm, SI-Cluster, to dynamically refine the K clusters by continuously quantifying and adjusting the weights on self-influence similarity and on multiple co-influence similarity scores towards the clustering convergence. To make SI-Cluster converge fast, we transformed a sophisticated nonlinear fractional programming problem of multiple weights into a straightforward nonlinear parametric programming problem of single variable.

Confluence can distinguish and quantify the effects of the different types of conformities. To scale up to large social networks, we propose a distributed learning method that can construct the Confluence model efficiently with near-linear speedup.

Here we present an analysis of longitudinal micro-blogging data, revealing a more nuanced view of the strategies employed by users when expanding their social circles. While the network structure affects the spread of information among users, the network is in turn shaped by this communication activity. This suggests a link creation mechanism whereby Alice is more likely to follow Charlie after seeing many messages by Charlie. We characterize users with a set of parameters associated with different link creation strategies, estimated by a Maximum-Likelihood approach. Triadic closure does have a strong effect on link formation, but shortcuts based on traffic are another key factor in interpreting network evolution. However, individual strategies for following other users are highly heterogeneous. Link creation behaviors can be summarized by classifying users in different categories with distinct structural and behavioral characteristics. Users who are popular, active, and influential tend to create traffic-based shortcuts, making the information diffusion process more efficient in the network.",187

We define the trace complexity as the number of distinct traces required to achieve high fidelity in reconstructing the topology of the unobserved network or, more generally, some of its properties. We give algorithms that are competitive with, while being simpler and more efficient than, existing network inference approaches. Moreover, we prove that our algorithms are nearly optimal, by proving an information-theoretic lower bound on the number of traces that an optimal inference algorithm requires for performing this task in the general case. Given these strong lower bounds, we turn our attention to special cases, such as trees and bounded-degree graphs, and to property recovery tasks, such as reconstructing the degree distribution without inferring the network. We show that these problems require a much smaller (and more realistic) number of traces, making them potentially solvable in practice.",98

Such a network comprises of a series of network snapshots with dynamic local states at nodes, and a global network state indicating the occurrence of an event. Mining discriminative subgraphs from global-state networks allows us to identify the influential sub-networks that have maximum impact on the global state and unearth the complex relationships between the local entities of a network and their collective behavior. In this paper, we explore this problem and design a technique called MINDS to mine minimally discriminative subgraphs from large global-state networks. To combat the exponential subgraph search space, we derive the concept of an edit map and perform Metropolis Hastings sampling on it to compute the answer set. Furthermore, we formulate the idea of network-constrained decision trees to learn prediction models that adhere to the underlying network structure. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate excellent accuracy in terms of prediction quality. Additionally, MINDS achieves a speed-up of at least four orders of magnitude over baseline techniques.",28

Using this information, it becomes possible to mine a much richer set of approximate subgraph patterns, which preserve the topology but allow bounded label mismatches.

We show that approximate mining yields interesting patterns in several real-world graphs ranging from IT and protein interaction networks to protein structures.",36

However, probabilistic frequent pattern mining suffers from the problem that an exponential number of result patterns are generated, which seriously hinders further evaluation and analysis. In this paper, we focus on the problem of mining probabilistic representative frequent patterns (P-RFP), which is the minimal set of patterns with adequately high probability to represent all frequent patterns. Observing the bottleneck in checking whether a pattern can probabilistically represent another, which involves the computation of a joint probability of the supports of two patterns, we introduce a novel approximation of the joint probability with both theoretical and empirical proofs. Based on the approximation, we propose an Approximate P-RFP Mining (APM) algorithm, which effectively and efficiently compresses the set of probabilistic frequent patterns. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze the relationship between two probabilistic frequent patterns through an approximate approach. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the APM algorithm accelerates P-RFP mining dramatically, orders of magnitudes faster than an exact solution. Moreover, the error rate of APM is guaranteed to be very small when the database contains hundreds transactions, which further affirms APM is a practical solution for summarizing probabilistic frequent patterns.",18

Tseng, ","Frequent episode mining (FEM) is an interesting research topic in data mining with wide range of applications. However, the traditional framework of FEM treats all events as having the same importance/utility and assumes that a same type of event appears at most once at any time point. These simplifying assumptions do not reflect the characteristics of scenarios in real applications and thus the useful information of episodes in terms of utilities such as profits is lost. Furthermore, most studies on FEM focused on mining episodes in simple event sequences and few considered the scenario of complex event sequences, where different events can occur simultaneously. To address these issues, in this paper, we incorporate the concept of utility into episode mining and address a new problem of mining high utility episodes from complex event sequences, which has not been explored so far. In the proposed framework, the importance/utility of different events is considered and multiple events can appear simultaneously. Several novel features are incorporated into the proposed framework to resolve the challenges raised by this new problem, such as the absence of anti-monotone property and the huge set of candidate episodes. Moreover, an efficient algorithm named UP-Span (Utility ePisodes mining by Spanning prefixes) is proposed for mining high utility episodes with several strategies incorporated for pruning the search space to achieve high efficiency. Experimental results on real and synthetic datasets show that UP-Span has excellent performance and serves as an effective solution to the new problem of mining high utility episodes from complex event sequences.",117

A common approach to tackle this problem is to introduce redundancy, that is, to request multiple workers to work on the same tasks. For simple multiple-choice tasks, several statistical methods to aggregate the multiple answers have been proposed. However, these methods cannot always be applied to more general tasks with unstructured response formats such as article writing, program coding, and logo designing, which occupy the majority on most crowdsourcing marketplaces. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised statistical quality estimation method for such general crowdsourcing tasks. Our method is based on the two-stage procedure; multiple workers are first requested to work on the same tasks in the creation stage, and then another set of workers review and grade each artifact in the review stage. We model the ability of each author and the bias of each reviewer, and propose a two-stage probabilistic generative model using the graded response model in the item response theory. Experiments using several general crowdsourcing tasks show that our method outperforms popular vote aggregation methods, which implies that our method can deliver high quality results with lower costs.",115

Previous studies usually took advantage of two major kinds of information for click prediction, i.e., relevance information representing the similarity between ads and queries and historical click-through information representing users' previous preferences on the ads. These existing works mainly focused on interpreting ad clicks in terms of what users seek (i.e., relevance information) and how users choose to click (historically clicked-through information). However, few of them attempted to understand why users click the ads. In this paper, we aim at answering this ``why'' question. In our opinion, users click those ads that can convince them to take further actions, and the critical factor is if those ads can trigger users' desires in their hearts. Our data analysis on a commercial search engine reveals that specific text patterns, e.g., ``official site'', ``$x\%$ off'', and ``guaranteed return in $x$ days'', are very effective in triggering users' desires, and therefore lead to significant differences in terms of click-through rate (CTR). These observations motivate us to systematically model user psychological desire in order for a precise prediction on ad clicks. To this end, we propose modeling user psychological desire in sponsored search according to Maslow's desire theory, which categorizes psychological desire into five levels and each one is represented by a set of textual patterns automatically mined from ad texts. We then construct novel features for both ads and users based on our definition on psychological desire and incorporate them into the learning framework of click prediction. Large scale evaluations on the click-through logs from a commercial search engine demonstrate that this approach can result in significant improvement in terms of click prediction accuracy, for both the ads with rich historical data and those with rare one. Further analysis reveals that specific pattern combinations are especially effective in driving click-through rates, which provides a good guideline for advertisers to improve their ad textual descriptions.",30

We run a detailed set of experiments on a variety of real graphs and demonstrate that the memory requirement of the algorithm is a tiny fraction of the graph. For example, even for a graph with 200 million edges, our algorithm stores just 60,000 edges to give accurate results.

Yu, ","Multi-label classification is prevalent in many real-world applications, where each example can be associated with a set of multiple labels simultaneously. The key challenge of multi-label classification comes from the large space of all possible label sets, which is exponential to the number of candidate labels. Most previous work focuses on exploiting correlations among different labels to facilitate the learning process. It is usually assumed that the label correlations are given beforehand or can be derived directly from data samples by counting their label co-occurrences. However, in many real-world multi-label classification tasks, the label correlations are not given and can be hard to learn directly from data samples within a moderate-sized training set. Heterogeneous information networks can provide abundant knowledge about relationships among different types of entities including data samples and class labels. In this paper, we propose to use heterogeneous information networks to facilitate the multi-label classification process. By mining the linkage structure of heterogeneous information networks, multiple types of relationships among different class labels and data samples can be extracted. Then we can use these relationships to effectively infer the correlations among different class labels in general, as well as the dependencies among the label sets of data examples inter-connected in the network. Empirical studies on real-world tasks demonstrate that the performance of multi-label classification can be effectively boosted using heterogeneous information net- works.",99

However, due to the reason of profit or fame, people try to game the system by opinion spamming (e.g., writing fake reviews) to promote or to demote some target products. In recent years, fake review detection has attracted significant attention from both the business and research communities. However, due to the difficulty of human labeling needed for supervised learning and evaluation, the problem remains to be highly challenging. This work proposes a novel angle to the problem by modeling spamicity as latent. An unsupervised model, called Author Spamicity Model (ASM), is proposed. It works in the Bayesian setting, which facilitates modeling spamicity of authors as latent and allows us to exploit various observed behavioral footprints of reviewers. The intuition is that opinion spammers have different behavioral distributions than non-spammers. This creates a distributional divergence between the latent population distributions of two clusters: spammers and non-spammers. Model inference results in learning the population distributions of the two clusters. Several extensions of ASM are also considered leveraging from different priors.

A significant challenge in the practical use of TV regularization lies in the nondifferentiable convex optimization, which is difficult to solve especially for large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose an efficient alternating augmented Lagrangian method (ADMM) to solve total variation regularization problems. The proposed algorithm is applicable for tensors, thus it can solve multidimensional total variation regularization problems. One appealing feature of the proposed algorithm is that it does not need to solve a linear system of equations, which is often the most expensive part in previous ADMM-based methods. In addition, each step of the proposed algorithm involves a set of independent and smaller problems, which can be solved in parallel. Thus, the proposed algorithm scales to large size problems. Furthermore, the global convergence of the proposed algorithm is guaranteed, and the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(dN/ε) on a d-mode tensor with N entries for achieving an ε-optimal solution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with current state-of-the-art methods.",47

It is critical to ensure the veracity of the produced data because responses collected from different users may be noisy and unreliable. Previous works solve this veracity problem by estimating both the user ability and question difficulty based on the knowledge in each task individually. In this case, each single task needs large amounts of data to provide accurate estimations. However, in practice, budgets provided by customers for a given target task may be limited, and hence each question can be presented to only a few users where each user can answer only a few questions. This data sparsity problem can cause previous approaches to perform poorly due to the overfitting problem on rare data and eventually damage the data veracity. Fortunately, in real-world applications, users can answer questions from multiple historical tasks. For example, one can annotate images as well as label the sentiment of a given title. In this paper, we employ transfer learning, which borrows knowledge from auxiliary historical tasks to improve the data veracity in a given target task. The motivation is that users have stable characteristics across different crowdsourcing tasks and thus data from different tasks can be exploited collectively to estimate users' abilities in the target task. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model, TLC (Transfer Learning for Crowdsourcing), to implement this idea by considering the overlapping users as a bridge. In addition, to avoid possible negative impact, TLC introduces task-specific factors to model task differences.

In this paper, we investigate the important problem of estimating information trustworthiness from the perspective of correlating and comparing multiple data sources. To a certain extent, the consistency degree is an indicator of information reliability--Information unanimously agreed by all the sources is more likely to be reliable. Based on this principle, we develop an effective computational approach to identify consistent information from multiple data sources. Particularly, we analyze vast amounts of information collected from multiple review platforms (multiple sources) in which people can rate and review the items they have purchased. The major challenge is that different platforms attract diverse sets of users, and thus information cannot be compared directly at the surface. However, latent reasons hidden in user ratings are mostly shared by multiple sources, and thus inconsistency about an item only appears when some source provides ratings deviating from the common latent reasons. Therefore, we propose a novel two-step procedure to calculate information consistency degrees for a set of items which are rated by multiple sets of users on different platforms. We first build a Multi-Source Deep Belief Network (MSDBN) to identify the common reasons hidden in multi-source rating data, and then calculate a consistency score for each item by comparing individual sources with the reconstructed data derived from the latent reasons. We conduct experiments on real user ratings collected from Orbitz, Priceline and TripAdvisor on all the hotels in Las Vegas and New York City. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully finds the hotels that receive inconsistent, and possibly unreliable, ratings.",50

In services such as Foursquare.com, whether a person likes an article is considered private and therefore not disclosed; only the aggregative statistics of articles (i.e., how many people like this article) is revealed. This paper tries to answer a question: can we predict the opinion holder in a heterogeneous social network without any labeled data? This question can be generalized to a link prediction with aggregative statistics problem. This paper devises a novel unsupervised framework to solve this problem, including two main components: (1) a three-layer factor graph model and three types of potential functions; (2) a ranked-margin learning and inference algorithm. Finally, we evaluate our method on four diverse prediction scenarios using four datasets: preference (Foursquare), repost (Twitter), response (Plurk), and citation (DBLP). We further exploit nine unsupervised models to solve this problem as baselines. Our approach not only wins out in all scenarios, but on the average achieves 9.90% AUC and 12.59% NDCG improvement over the best competitors.

Kranzler, ","Identifying genetic variation underlying a complex disease is important. Many complex diseases have heterogeneous phenotypes and are products of a variety of genetic and environmental factors acting in concert. Deriving highly heritable quantitative traits of a complex disease can improve the identification of genetic risk of the disease. The most sophisticated methods so far perform unsupervised cluster analysis on phenotypic features; and then a quantitative trait is derived based on each resultant cluster. Heritability is estimated to assess the validity of the derived quantitative traits. However, none of these methods explicitly maximize the heritability of the derived traits. We propose a quadratic optimization approach that directly utilizes heritability as an objective during the derivation of quantitative traits of a disease. This method maximizes an objective function that is formulated by decomposing the traditional maximum likelihood method for estimating heritability of a quantitative trait. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both synthetic data and real-world problems. We apply our algorithm to identify highly heritable traits of complex human-behavior disorders including opioid and cocaine use disorders, and highly heritable traits of dairy cattle that are economically important.

Recognizing the role of repeated exposure to a message, in this paper we propose a novel framework for the effective placement of content: Given the navigational patterns of users in a network, e.g., web graph, hyperlinked corpus, or road network, and given a model of the relationship between content-adoption and frequency of exposition, we define the repetition-aware content-placement (RACP) problem as that of identifying the set of B nodes on which content should be placed so that the expected number of users adopting that content is maximized. The key contribution of our work is the introduction of memory into the navigation process, by making user conversion dependent on the number of her exposures to that content. This dependency is captured using a conversion model that is general enough to capture arbitrary dependencies. Our solution to this general problem builds upon the notion of absorbing random walks, which we extend appropriately in order to address the technicalities of our definitions.

In this paper, we attempt harnessing historical cascade data, propose a novel data driven approach to select important nodes as sensors, and predict the outbreaks based on the cascading behaviors of these sensors. In particular, we propose Orthogonal Sparse LOgistic Regression (OSLOR) method to jointly optimize node selection and outbreak prediction, where the prediction loss are combined with an orthogonal regularizer and L1 regularizer to guarantee good prediction accuracy, as well as the sparsity and low-redundancy of selected sensors.

In literature, many existing studies have attempted to formulate the problem as a regular supervised binary classification task, which typically aims to optimize the prediction accuracy. However, in a real-world malicious URL detection task, the ratio between the number of malicious URLs and legitimate URLs is highly imbalanced, making it very inappropriate for simply optimizing the prediction accuracy. Besides, another key limitation of the existing work is to assume a large amount of training data is available, which is impractical as the human labeling cost could be potentially quite expensive. To solve these issues, in this paper, we present a novel framework of Cost-Sensitive Online Active Learning (CSOAL), which only queries a small fraction of training data for labeling and directly optimizes two cost-sensitive measures to address the class-imbalance issue. In particular, we propose two CSOAL algorithms and analyze their theoretical performance in terms of cost-sensitive bounds. We conduct an extensive set of experiments to examine the empirical performance of the proposed algorithms for a large-scale challenging malicious URL detection task, in which the encouraging results showed that the proposed technique by querying an extremely small-sized labeled data (about 0.5% out of 1-million instances) can achieve better or highly comparable classification performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art cost-insensitive and cost-sensitive online classification algorithms using a huge amount of labeled data.",125

Nowadays, users engage in multiple networks and form a ""composite social network"" by considering common users as the bridge. State-of-the-art network-dynamics analysis is performed in isolation for individual networks, but users' interactions in one network can influence their behaviors in other networks, and in an individual network, different types of user interactions also affect each other. Without considering the influences across networks, one may not be able to model the dynamics in a given network correctly due to the lack of information. In this paper, we study the problem of modeling the dynamics of composite networks, where the evolution processes of different networks are jointly considered. However, due to the difference in network properties, simply merging multiple networks into a single one is not ideal because individual evolution patterns may be ignored and network differences may bring negative impacts. The proposed solution is a nonparametric Bayesian model, which models each user's common latent features to extract the cross-network influences, and use network-specific factors to describe different networks' evolution patterns. Empirical studies on large-scale dynamic composite social networks demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the performance of link prediction over several state-of-the-art baselines and unfolds the network evolution accurately.",29

This motivated us to propose a time-dependent loss function which allows the inclusion of the information about the distribution shifts in the series directly into the SVM learning process.

From the analysis of the social media data we found that users are quite inactive in rating/voting. For example, a user on average only votes 2 out of 100 accessed items. Traditional recommendation methods are mostly based on users' votes and thus can not cope with this situation. Based on the observation that the dwell time on an item may reflect the opinion of a user, we aim to enrich the user-vote matrix by converting the dwell time on items into users' ``pseudo votes'' and then help improve recommendation performance. However, it is challenging to correctly interpret the dwell time since many subjective human factors, e.g. user expectation, sensitivity to various item qualities, reading speed, are involved into the casual behavior of online reading. In psychology, it is assumed that people have choice threshold in decision making. The time spent on making decision reflects the decision maker's threshold. This idea inspires us to develop a View-Voting model, which can estimate how much the user likes the viewed item according to her dwell time, and thus make recommendations even if there is no voting data available.

Given a node v in a graph G, an SSD query from v asks for the distance from $v$ to any other node in G, while an SSSP query retrieves the shortest path from v to any other node. These two types of queries find important applications in graph analysis, especially in the computation of graph measures. Most of the existing solutions for SSD and SSSP queries, however, require that the input graph fits in the main memory, which renders them inapplicable for the massive disk-resident graphs commonly used in web and social applications. There are several techniques that are designed to be I/O efficient, but they all focus on undirected and/or unweighted graphs, and they only offer sub-optimal query efficiency. To address the deficiency of existing work, this paper presents Highways-on-Disk (HoD), a disk-based index that supports both SSD and SSSP queries on directed and weighted graphs. The key idea of HoD is to augment the input graph with a set of auxiliary edges, and exploit them during query processing to reduce I/O and computation costs.

The key idea of our approach is to use more than one similarity matrices over drugs as well as those over targets, where weights over the multiple similarity matrices are estimated from data to automatically select similarities, which are effective for improving the performance of predicting drug-target interactions. We propose a factor model, named Multiple Similarities Collaborative Matrix Factorization(MSCMF), which projects drugs and targets into a common low-rank feature space, which is further consistent with weighted similarity matrices over drugs and those over targets. These two low-rank matrices and weights over similarity matrices are estimated by an alternating least squares algorithm. Our approach allows to predict drug-target interactions by the two low-rank matrices collaboratively and to detect similarities which are important for predicting drug-target interactions. This approach is general and applicable to any binary relations with similarities over elements, being found in many applications, such as recommender systems. In fact, MSCMF is an extension of weighted low-rank approximation for one-class collaborative filtering. We extensively evaluated the performance of MSCMF by using both synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results showed nice properties of MSCMF on selecting similarities useful in improving the predictive performance and the performance advantage of MSCMF over six state-of-the-art methods for predicting drug-target interactions.",273

However, many real world applications require an integrated approach for creating, refining and selecting features. To address this problem, we propose FeaFiner (short for Feature Refiner), an efficient formulation that simultaneously generalizes low-level features into higher level concepts and then selects relevant concepts based on the target variable. Specifically, we formulate a double sparsity optimization problem that identifies groups in the low-level features, generalizes higher level features using the groups and performs feature selection. Since in many clinical researches non- overlapping groups are preferred for better interpretability, we further improve the formulation to generalize features using mutually exclusive feature groups. The proposed formulation is challenging to solve due to the orthogonality constraints, non-convexity objective and non-smoothness penal- ties. We apply a recently developed augmented Lagrangian method to solve this formulation in which each subproblem is solved by a non-monotone spectral projected gradient method. Our numerical experiments show that this approach is computationally efficient and also capable of producing solutions of high quality. We also present a generalization bound showing the consistency and the asymptotic behavior of the learning process of our proposed formulation.",29

Due to its complexity and its connection to location based social networks (LBSNs), the decision process of a user choose a POI is complex and can be influenced by various factors, such as user preferences, geographical influences, and user mobility behaviors. While there are some studies on POI recommendations, it lacks of integrated analysis of the joint effect of multiple factors. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel geographical probabilistic factor analysis framework which strategically takes various factors into consideration. Specifically, this framework allows to capture the geographical influences on a user's check-in behavior. Also, the user mobility behaviors can be effectively exploited in the recommendation model. Moreover, the recommendation model can effectively make use of user check-in count data as implicity user feedback for modeling user preferences. Finally, experimental results on real-world LBSNs data show that the proposed recommendation method outperforms state-of-the-art latent factor models with a significant margin.",472

Although current graph models can capture several important characteristics of social network graphs (e.g., degree, path lengths), many of them do not generate graphs with sufficient variation to reflect the natural variability in real world graph domains. One exception is the mixed Kronecker Product Graph Model (mKPGM), a generalization of the Kronecker Product Graph Model, which uses parameter tying to capture variance in the underlying distribution [10]. The enhanced representation of mKPGMs enables them to match both the mean graph statistics and their spread as observed in real network populations, but unfortunately to date, the only method to estimate mKPGMs involves an exhaustive search over the parameters.",18

Despite technological advances facilitating access to a wide range of media commodities, finding engaging content is a major enterprise with few principled solutions. Systems tracking spontaneous devaluation in user preferences can allow prediction of the onset of boredom in users potentially catering to their changed needs. In this work, we study the music listening histories of Last.fm users focusing on the changes in their preferences based on their choices for different artists at different points in time. A hazard function, commonly used in statistics for survival analysis, is used to capture the rate at which a user returns to an artist as a function of exposure to the artist. The analysis provides the first evidence of spontaneous devaluation in preferences of music listeners. Better understanding of the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon can inform solutions to the similarity-diversity dilemma of recommender systems.",14

Such disambiguation can help enhance readability and add semantics to plain text. It is also a central step in constructing high-quality information network or knowledge graph from unstructured text. Previous research has tackled this problem by making use of various textual and structural features from a knowledge base. Most of the proposed algorithms assume that a knowledge base can provide enough explicit and useful information to help disambiguate a mention to the right entity. However, the existing knowledge bases are rarely complete (likely will never be), thus leading to poor performance on short queries with not well-known contexts. In such cases, we need to collect additional evidences scattered in internal and external corpus to augment the knowledge bases and enhance their disambiguation power. In this work, we propose a generative model and an incremental algorithm to automatically mine useful evidences across documents. With a specific modeling of ""background topic"" and ""unknown entities"", our model is able to harvest useful evidences out of noisy information. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches significantly: boosting the disambiguation accuracy from 43% (baseline) to 86% on short queries derived from tweets.",126

It uses one truthful review as a template, and replaces its sentences with those from other reviews in a repository. Fake reviews generated by this mechanism are extremely hard to detect: Both the state-of-the-art computational approaches and human readers acquire an error rate of 35%-48%, just slightly better than a random guess. While it is challenging to detect such fake reviews, we have made solid progress in suppressing them.

In this paper, we propose a novel way of analyzing literature citation to explore the research topics and the theme evolution by modeling article citation relations with a probabilistic generative model. The key idea is to represent a research paper by a ``bag of citations'' and model such a ``citation document'' with a probabilistic topic model. We explore the extension of a particular topic model, i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation~(LDA), for citation analysis, and show that such a Citation-LDA can facilitate discovering of individual research topics as well as the theme evolution from multiple related topics, both of which in turn lead to the construction of evolution graphs for characterizing research themes. We test the proposed citation-LDA on two datasets: the ACL Anthology Network(AAN) of natural language research literatures and PubMed Central(PMC) archive of biomedical and life sciences literatures, and demonstrate that Citation-LDA can effectively discover the evolution of research themes, with better formed topics than (conventional) Content-LDA.",52

Yan, ","In sponsored search auctions, the auctioneer operates the marketplace by setting a number of auction parameters such as reserve prices for the task of auction optimization. The auction parameters may be set for each individual keyword, but the optimization problem becomes intractable since the number of keywords is in the millions. To reduce the dimensionality and generalize well, one wishes to cluster keywords or queries into meaningful groups, and set parameters at the keyword-cluster level. For auction optimization, keywords shall be deemed as interchangeable commodities with respect to their valuations from advertisers, represented as bid distributions or landscapes. Clustering keywords for auction optimization shall thus be based on their bid distributions. In this paper we present a formalism of clustering probability distributions, and its application to query clustering where each query is represented as a probability density of click-through rate (CTR) weighted bid and distortion is measured by KL divergence. We first derive a k-means variant for clustering Gaussian densities, which have a closed-form KL divergence. We then develop an algorithm for clustering Gaussian mixture densities, which generalize a single Gaussian and are typically a more realistic parametric assumption for real-world data. The KL divergence between Gaussian mixture densities is no longer analytically tractable; hence we derive a variational EM algorithm that minimizes an upper bound of the total within-cluster KL divergence. The clustering algorithm has been deployed successfully into production, yielding significant improvement in revenue and clicks over the existing production system. While motivated by the specific setting of query clustering, the proposed clustering method is generally applicable to many real-world applications where an example is better characterized by a distribution than a finite-dimensional feature vector in Euclidean space as in the classical k-means.",10

At Microsoft's Bing, the use of controlled experiments has grown exponentially over time, with over 200 concurrent experiments now running on any given day. Running experiments at large scale requires addressing multiple challenges in three areas: cultural/organizational, engineering, and trustworthiness. On the cultural and organizational front, the larger organization needs to learn the reasons for running controlled experiments and the tradeoffs between controlled experiments and other methods of evaluating ideas. We discuss why negative experiments, which degrade the user experience short term, should be run, given the learning value and long-term benefits. On the engineering side, we architected a highly scalable system, able to handle data at massive scale: hundreds of concurrent experiments, each containing millions of users. Classical testing and debugging techniques no longer apply when there are billions of live variants of the site, so alerts are used to identify issues rather than relying on heavy up-front testing.

Search federation deals with problems of the selection of search engines to query and merging of their results into a single result set. Despite a few recent advances, the problem is still very challenging. First, due to the heterogeneous nature of different verticals, how the system merges the vertical results with the web documents to serve the user's information need is still an open problem. Moreover, the scale of the search engine and the increasing number of vertical properties requires a solution which is efficient and scaleable. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for the search federation problem. We model the search federation as a contextual bandit problem. The system uses reward as a proxy for user satisfaction. Given a query, our system predicts the expected reward for each vertical, then organizes the search result page (SERP) in a way which maximizes the total reward.

Dimensionality reduction within this space is useful, as it decreases scoring time and model storage requirements. To meet this need, we develop a novel algorithm for scalable supervised dimensionality reduction across hundreds of simultaneous classification tasks. The algorithm performs hierarchical clustering in the space of model parameters from historical models in order to collapse related features into a single dimension. This allows us to implicitly incorporate feature and label data across all tasks without operating directly in a massive space.

To better understand and simulate human mobility during the disasters, we develop a probabilistic model that is able to be effectively trained by the discovered evacuations via machine learning technique. Based on our training model, population mobility in various cities impacted by the disasters throughout the country is able to be automatically simulated or predicted. On the basis of the whole database, developed model, and experimental results, it is easy for us to find some new features or population mobility patterns after the recent severe earthquake, tsunami and release of radioactivity in Japan, which are likely to play a vital role in future disaster relief and management worldwide.",98

In fact, a quarter of the industry-track papers for KDD in 2012 were based on data generated by online actions. The models, analytics and decisions they inform all stem from the assumption that observed data captures the intent of users. However, a large portion of these observed actions are not intentional, and are effectively polluting the models. Much of this observed activity is either generated by robots traversing the internet or the result of unintended actions of real users. These non-intentional actions observed in the web logs severely bias both analytics and the models created from the data. In this paper, we will show examples of how non-intentional traffic that is produced by fraudulent activities adversely affects both general analytics and predictive models, and propose an approach using co-visitation networks to identify sites that have large amounts of this fraudulent traffic. We will then show how this approach, along with a second stage classifier that identifies non-intentional traffic at the browser level, is deployed in production at Media6Degrees (m6d), a targeting technology company for display advertising. This deployed product acts both to filter out the fraudulent traffic from the input data and to insure that we don't serve ads during unintended website visits.",23

Baseman, ","We describe methods for continual prediction of manufactured product quality prior to final testing. In our most expansive modeling approach, an estimated final characteristic of a product is updated after each manufacturing operation. Our initial application is for the manufacture of microprocessors, and we predict final microprocessor speed. Using these predictions, early corrective manufacturing actions may be taken to increase the speed of expected slow wafers (a collection of microprocessors) or reduce the speed of fast wafers. Such predictions may also be used to initiate corrective supply chain management actions. Developing statistical learning models for this task has many complicating factors: (a) a temporally unstable population (b) missing data that is a result of sparsely sampled measurements and (c) relatively few available measurements prior to corrective action opportunities. In a real manufacturing pilot application, our automated models selected 125 fast wafers in real-time. As predicted, those wafers were significantly faster than average. During manufacture, downstream corrective processing restored 25 nominally unacceptable wafers to normal operation.",17

The proposed method analyses a complex and formerly impenetrable volume of data from roads and crashes using data mining. This method rapidly identifies roads with elevated crash-rate, potentially due to skid resistance deficit, for investigation. A hypothetical skid resistance/crash risk curve is developed for each road segment, driven by the model deployed in a novel regression tree extrapolation method. The method potentially solves the problem of missing skid resistance values which occurs during network-wide crash analysis, and allows risk assessment of the major proportion of roads without skid resistance values.",1

In this paper, we propose Wiscom, a system that can analyze tens of millions user ratings and comments in mobile app markets at three different levels of detail. Our system is able to (a) discover inconsistencies in reviews; (b) identify reasons why users like or dislike a given app, and provide an interactive, zoomable view of how users' reviews evolve over time; and (c) provide valuable insights into the entire app market, identifying users' major concerns and preferences of different types of apps.

Extreme Flood is usually a consequence of a sequence of precipitation events occurring over from several days to several weeks. Though precise short-term forecasting the magnitude and extent of individual precipitation event is still beyond our reach, long-term forecasting of precipitation clusters can be attempted by identifying persistent atmospheric regimes that are conducive for the precipitation clusters. However, such forecasting will suffer from overwhelming number of relevant features and high imbalance of sample sets. In this paper, we propose an integrated data mining framework for identifying the precursors to precipitation event clusters and use this information to predict extended periods of extreme precipitation and subsequent floods. We synthesize a representative feature set that describes the atmosphere motion, and apply a streaming feature selection algorithm to online identify the precipitation precursors from the enormous feature space. A hierarchical re-sampling approach is embedded in the framework to deal with the imbalance problem. An extensive empirical study is conducted on historical precipitation and associated flood data collected in the State of Iowa. Utilizing our framework a few physically meaningful precipitation cluster precursor sets are identified from millions of features. More than 90% of extreme precipitation events are captured by the proposed prediction model using precipitation cluster precursors with a lead time of more than 5 days.",21

While the domain implications of such collaboration are well known, this type of data has been explored to a limited extent in the data mining community. The objective of this paper is two fold: first, we introduce the emerging domain of ""big"" healthcare claims data to the KDD community, and second, we describe the success and challenges that we encountered in analyzing this data using state of art analytics for massive data. Specifically, we translate the problem of analyzing healthcare data into some of the most well-known analysis problems in the data mining community, social network analysis, text mining, and temporal analysis and higher order feature construction, and describe how advances within each of these areas can be leveraged to understand the domain of healthcare.

In this paper, we aim to detect electric heat pumps from coarse grained smart meter data for a heat pump marketing campaign. However, appliance detection is a challenging task, especially given a very low granularity and partial labeled even unlabeled data. Traditional methods install either a high granularity smart meter or sensors at every appliance, which is either too expensive or requires technical expertise. We propose a novel approach to detect heat pumps that utilizes low granularity smart meter data, prior sales data and weather data. In particular, motivated by the characteristics of heat pump consumption pattern, we extract novel features that are highly relevant to heat pump usage from smart meter data and weather data. Under the constraint that only a subset of heat pump users are available, we formalize the problem into a positive and unlabeled data classification and apply biased Support Vector Machine (BSVM) to our extracted features. Our empirical study on a real-world data set demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, our method has been deployed in a real-life setting where the partner electric company runs a targeted campaign for 292,496 customers. Based on the initial feedback, our detection algorithm can successfully detect substantial number of non-heat pump users who were identified heat pump users with the prior algorithm the company had used.",30

We present a methodology based on empirical Bayes modeling to combine ADR signals mined from ~5 million adverse event reports collected by the FDA, and healthcare data corresponding to 46 million patients' the main two types of information sources currently employed for signal detection. Based on four sets of test cases (gold standard), we demonstrate that our method leads to a statistically significant and substantial improvement in signal detection accuracy, averaging 40% over the use of each source independently, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.87. We also compare the method with alternative supervised learning approaches, and argue that our approach is preferable as it does not require labeled (training) samples whose availability is currently limited.

Due to the demand for better sports analytics and the improvement in sensor technology, there has been a plethora of ball and player tracking information generated within professional sports for analytical purposes. However, due to the continuous nature of the data and the lack of associated high-level labels to describe it - this rich set of information has had very limited use especially in the analysis of a team's tactics and strategy. In this paper, we give an overview of the types of analysis currently performed mostly with hand-labeled event data and highlight the problems associated with the influx of spatiotemporal data. By way of example, we present an approach which uses an entire season of ball tracking data from the English Premier League (2010-2011 season) to reinforce the common held belief that teams should aim to ""win home games and draw away ones"". We do this by: i) forming a representation of team behavior by chunking the incoming spatiotemporal signal into a series of quantized bins, and ii) generate an expectation model of team behavior based on a code-book of past performances. We show that home advantage in soccer is partly due to the conservative strategy of the away team.

The discovery of communities that are geographically disperse stems from the requirement to identify higher-level organizational structures, such as a logistics group that provides support to various geographically disperse terrorist cells. We apply a variant of Newman-Girvan modularity to this problem known as distance modularity. To address the problem of finding geographically disperse communities, we modify the well-known Louvain algorithm to find partitions of networks that provide near-optimal solutions to this quantity. We apply this algorithm to numerous samples from two real-world social networks and a terrorism network data set whose nodes have associated geospatial locations.

However, most drivers fear of being monitored once the government installs the devices in their vehicles to collect GPS data.

This framework assumes DSMS server is secure and trustable, and protects providers' data from illegal access by data users. In ERP 2, the DSMS server is maintained by the government, i.e., data user.

The other is a temporal classifier based on a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF), involving temporally-related features (e.g., traffic and meteorology) to model the temporal dependency of air quality in a location.

Yu, ","With the growth of location-based services and social services, low- sampling-rate trajectories from check-in data or photos with geo- tag information becomes ubiquitous. In general, most detailed mov- ing information in low-sampling-rate trajectories are lost. Prior works have elaborated on distant-time location prediction in high- sampling-rate trajectories. However, existing prediction models are pattern-based and thus not applicable due to the sparsity of data points in low-sampling-rate trajectories. To address the sparsity in low-sampling-rate trajectories, we develop a Reachability-based prediction model on Time-constrained Mobility Graph (RTMG) to predict locations for distant-time queries. Specifically, we de- sign an adaptive temporal exploration approach to extract effective supporting trajectories that are temporally close to the query time. Based on the supporting trajectories, a Time-constrained mobility Graph (TG) is constructed to capture mobility information at the given query time. In light of TG, we further derive the reacha- bility probabilities among locations in TG. Thus, a location with maximum reachability from the current location among all possi- ble locations in supporting trajectories is considered as the predic- tion result. To efficiently process queries, we proposed the index structure Sorted Interval-Tree (SOIT) to organize location records. Extensive experiments with real data demonstrated the effective- ness and efficiency of RTMG. First, RTMG with adaptive tempo- ral exploration significantly outperforms the existing pattern-based prediction model HPM [2] over varying data sparsity in terms of higher accuracy and higher coverage. Also, the proposed index structure SOIT can efficiently speedup RTMG in large-scale trajec- tory dataset. In the future, we could extend RTMG by considering more factors (e.g., staying durations in locations, application us- ages in smart phones) to further improve the prediction accuracy.",15

Personal attributes of a user, including name, location, education, ethnicity, gender, and political and religious affiliations, can be found in social media sites. In this paper, we present a novel web-based tool for collecting the attributes of interest associated with a particular social media user related to the received information. This tool provides a way to combine different attributes available at different social media sites into a single user profile. Using different types of Twitter users, we also evaluate the performance of the tool in terms of number of attribute values collected, validity of these values, and total amount of retrieval time.",30

Beyond public interests (e.g., sports, music), microblogs can provide highly detailed information for those interested in public health, homeland security, and financial analysis. However, the language used in Twitter is heavily informal, ungrammatical, and dynamic. Existing data mining algorithms require extensive manually labeling to build and maintain a supervised system. This paper presents STED, a semi-supervised system that helps users to automatically detect and interactively visualize events of a targeted type from twitter, such as crimes, civil unrests, and disease outbreaks. Our model first applies transfer learning and label propagation to automatically generate labeled data, then learns a customized text classifier based on mini-clustering, and finally applies fast spatial scan statistics to estimate the locations of events. We demonstrate STED's usage and benefits using twitter data collected from Latin America countries, and show how our system helps to detect and track example events such as civil unrests and crimes.",73

Here people share their experiences and opinions on various topics, including personal health issues, symptoms, treatments, side-effects, and so on. This makes publicly available social media data an invaluable resource for mining interesting and actionable healthcare insights. In this paper, we describe a novel real-time flu and cancer surveillance system that uses spatial, temporal, and text mining on Twitter data. The real-time analysis results are reported visually in terms of US disease surveillance maps, distribution and timelines of disease types, symptoms, and treatments, in addition to overall disease activity timelines on our project website. Our surveillance system can be very useful not only for early prediction of seasonal disease outbreaks such as flu, but also for monitoring distribution of cancer patients with different cancer types and symptoms in each state and the popularity of treatments used. The resulting insights are expected to help facilitate faster response to and preparation for epidemics and also be very useful for both patients and doctors to make more informed decisions.",230

Lakshmanan, Evangelos Milios, ","Online social streams such as Twitter/Facebook timelines and forum discussions have emerged as prevalent channels for information dissemination. As these social streams surge quickly, information overload has become a huge problem. Existing keyword search engines on social streams like Twitter Search are not successful in overcoming the problem, because they merely return an overwhelming list of posts, with little aggregation or semantics. In this demo, we provide a new solution called \keysee by grouping posts into events, and track the evolution patterns of events as new posts stream in and old posts fade out. Noise and redundancy problems are effectively addressed in our system. Our demo supports refined keyword query on evolving events by allowing users to specify the time span and designated evolution pattern. For each event result, we provide various analytic views such as frequency curves, word clouds and GPS distributions. We deploy \keysee on real Twitter streams and the results show that our demo outperforms existing keyword search engines on both quality and usability.",23

Particularly information about linear TV broadcast programs has been available in a form limited to program guides that provide short manually described overviews of the program content. Recent development in digitalization of TV broadcasting and emergence of web-based services for catch-up and on-demand viewing bring out new possibilities to access data. In this paper we introduce our data mining system and accompanying services for summarizing Finnish DVB broadcast streams from seven national channels. We describe how data mining of novelty concepts can be extracted from DVB subtitles to augment web-based ""Catch-Up TV Guide"" and ""Novelty Cloud"" TV services. Furthermore, our system allows accessing media fragments as Picture Quotes via generated word lists and provides content-based recommendations to find new programs that have content similar to the user selected programs. Our index consists of over 180 000 programs that are used to recommend relevant programs. The service has been under development and available online since 2010.

Moreover, such data objects are often linked together (e.g., structured specification of products linking with the corresponding product descriptions and customer comments). Even for text data such as news data, typed entities can be extracted with entity extraction tools. The EventCube project constructs TextCube and TopicCube from interconnected structured and text data (or from text data via entity extraction and dimension building), and performs multidimensional search and analysis on such datasets, in an informative, powerful, and user-friendly manner. This proposed EventCube demo will show the power of the system not only on the originally designed ASRS (Aviation Safety Report System) data sets, but also on news datasets collected from multiple news agencies, and academic datasets constructed from the DBLP and web data. The system has high potential to be extended in many powerful ways and serve as a general platform for search, OLAP (online analytical processing) and data mining on integrated text and structured data.

Weibo, a famous ""Chinese Twitter"", has attracted over 0.5 billion users in less than four years, with more than 1000 tweets generated in every second. These tweets are informative but very fragmented, and thus would be better archived from an event perspective, as done by Weibo itself in the ""Micro-Topic"" program. This effort, however, is yet far from satisfaction for not providing enough analytical power to events. In light of this, in this demo paper, we propose SEA, a System for Event Analysis on Chinese tweets. In general, SEA is an event-centric, multi-functional platform that conducts panoramic analysis on Weibo events from various aspects, including the semantic information of the events, the temporal and spatial trends, the public sentiments, the hidden sub-events, the key users in the event diffusion and their preferences, etc. These functions are enabled by the integration of various analytical models and by the noSQL techniques adopted purposefully for massive tweets management. Finally, a case study on the ""Spring Festival"" event demonstrates the effectiveness of SEA. To our best knowledge, SEA is the first third-party system that provides panoramic analysis to Weibo events.",8

Since user profiles on Twitter do not reveal user interests and skills, we transfer the knowledge from categorized Yahoo! Answers datasets for learning user expertise. Then, we select the right crowd for certain tasks based on user expertise. We study the effectiveness of our system using extensive user evaluation.
