Many event-driven methods utilized the events extracted from news, social media, and discussion board to forecast the stock trend in recent years. However, existing event-driven methods have two main shortcomings: 1) overlooking the influence of event information differentiated by the stock-dependent properties; 2) neglecting the effect of event information from other related stocks. In this paper, we propose a relational event-driven stock trend forecasting (REST) framework, which can address the shortcoming of existing methods. To remedy the first shortcoming, we propose to model the stock context and learn the effect of event information on the stocks under different contexts. To address the second shortcoming, we construct a stock graph and design a new propagation layer to propagate the effect of event information from related stocks. The experimental studies on the real-world data demonstrate the efficiency of our REST framework. The results of investment simulation show that our framework can achieve a higher return of investment than baselines.",4

Despite advances in stock forecasting, a limitation of most existing neural methods is that they treat stocks independent of each other, ignoring the valuable rich signals between related stocks’ movements. Motivated by financial literature that shows stock markets and inter-stock correlations show scale-free network characteristics, we leverage domain knowledge on the Web to model inter-stock relations as a graph in four major global stock markets and formulate stock selection as a scale-free graph-based learning to rank problem. To capture the scale-free spatial and temporal dependencies in stock prices, we propose HyperStockGAT: Hyperbolic Stock Graph Attention Network, the first model on the Riemannian Manifolds for stock selection. Our work’s key novelty is the proposal of modeling the complex, scale-free nature of inter-stock relations through temporal hyperbolic graph learning on Riemannian manifolds that can represent the spatial correlations between stocks more accurately. Through extensive experiments on long-term real-world data spanning over six years on four of the world’s biggest markets: NASDAQ, NYSE, TSE, and China exchanges, we show that HyperStockGAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art stock forecasting methods in terms of profitability by over 12%, and risk-adjusted Sharpe Ratio by over 4%. We analyze HyperStockGAT’s components’ contributions through a series of exploratory and ablative experiments to demonstrate its practical applicability to real-world trading. Furthermore, we propose a novel hyperbolic architecture that can be applied across various spatiotemporal problems on the Web’s commonly occurring scale-free networks.",4

The advantage for users is that the funds are not in custody of a centralized external entity. However, these exchanges are prone to manipulative behavior. In this paper, we illustrate how wash trading activity can be identified on two of the first popular limit order book-based decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain, IDEX and EtherDelta. We identify a lower bound of accounts and trading structures that meet the legal definitions of wash trading, discovering that they are responsible for a wash trading volume in equivalent of 159 million U.S. Dollars. While self-trades and two-account structures are predominant, complex forms also occur. We quantify these activities, finding that on both exchanges, more than 30% of all traded tokens have been subject to wash trading activity. On EtherDelta, 10% of the tokens have almost exclusively been wash traded. All data is made available for future research. Our findings underpin the need for countermeasures that are applicable in decentralized systems.",11

Although several heuristics have been used to break the anonymity, new approaches are proposed to enhance its anonymity at the same time. One of them is the mixing service. Unfortunately, mixing services have been abused to facilitate criminal activities, e.g., money laundering. As such, there is an urgent need to systematically understand Bitcoin mixing services.",4

In this paper we explore this new paradigm through a study of BitMEX, one of the first and most successful derivatives platforms for leveraged cryptocurrency trading. BitMEX trades on average over 3 billion dollars worth of volume per day, and allows users to go long or short Bitcoin with up to 100x leverage. We analyze the evolution of BitMEX products—both settled and perpetual offerings that have become the standard across other cryptocurrency derivatives platforms. We additionally utilize on-chain forensics, public liquidation events, and a site-wide chat room to describe the diverse ensemble of amateur and professional traders that forms this community. These traders range from wealthy agents running automated strategies, to individuals trading small, risky positions and focusing on very short time-frames. Finally, we discuss how derivative trading has impacted cryptocurrency asset prices, notably how it has led to dramatic price movements in the underlying spot markets.",3

Modeling language-specific built-in functions is essential for symbolic execution. Since built-in functions tend to be complicated and are typically implemented in low-level languages, a common strategy is to manually translate them into the SMT-LIB language for constraint solving. Such translation requires an excessive amount of human effort and deep understandings of the function behaviors. Incorrect translation can invalidate the final results. This problem aggravates in PHP applications because of their cross-language nature, i.e., , the built-in functions are written in C, but the rest code is in PHP.",1

Such measurements implicitly assume that automated crawls generalize to typical web user experience. But anecdotal evidence suggests the web behaves differently when seen via well-known measurement endpoints or measurement automation frameworks, for various reasons. Our work improves the state of web privacy and security by investigating how key measurements differ when using naive crawling tool defaults vs. careful attempts to match “real” users across the Tranco top 25k web domains. We find web privacy and security measurements significantly affected by vantage point and browser configuration. We conclude that unless researchers ensure their web measurement tools match real world user experience, the research community is likely missing important signals systematically. For example, we find browser configuration alone causing shifts in 19% of known ad and tracking domains encountered and altering the loading frequency of up to 10% of distinct JavaScript code units executed. We find network vantage point having similar, though less dramatic, effects on the same web metrics. To ensure reproducibility, we carefully document our methodology and publish both our code and collected data.",3

Many security vendors and security professionals use Twitter in practice for collecting Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). However, little is known about IOCs on Twitter. Their important characteristics such as earliness, uniqueness, and accuracy have never been investigated. Moreover, how to extract IOCs from Twitter with high accuracy is not obvious. In this paper, we present Twiti, a system that automatically extracts various forms of malware IOCs from Twitter. Based on the collected IOCs, we conduct the first empirical assessment and thorough analysis of malware IOCs on Twitter. Twiti extracts IOCs from tweets identified as having malware IOC information by leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques. With extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that not only can Twiti extract malware IOCs accurately, but also the extracted IOCs are unique and early. By analyzing IOCs in Twiti from various aspects, we find that Twitter captures ongoing malware threats such as Emotet variants and malware distribution sites better than other public threat intelligence (TI) feeds. We also find that only a tiny fraction of IOCs on Twitter come from commercial vendor accounts and individual Twitter users are the main contributors of the early detected or exclusive IOCs, which indicates that Twitter can provide many valuable IOCs uncovered in commercial domain",0

However, it also introduces a single point of failure since all service providers fully trust the identity of a user created by the SSO identity provider. In this paper, we investigate the identity-account inconsistency threat, a new SSO vulnerability that can cause the compromise of online accounts. The vulnerability exists because current SSO systems highly rely on a user’s email address to bind an account with a real identity, but ignore the fact that email addresses might be reused by other users. We reveal that under the SSO authentication, such inconsistency allows an adversary controlling a reused email address to take over associated online accounts without knowing any credentials like passwords. Specifically, we first conduct a measurement study on the account management policies for multiple cloud email providers, showing the feasibility of acquiring previously used email accounts. We further perform a systematic study on 100 popular websites using the Google business email service with our own domain address and demonstrate that most online accounts can be compromised by exploiting this inconsistency vulnerability. To shed light on email reuse in the wild, we analyze the commonly used naming conventions that lead to a wide existence of potential email address collisions, and conduct a case study on the account policies of U.S. universities. Finally, we propose several useful practices for end-users, service providers, and identity providers to protect against this identity-account inconsistency threat.",0

These algorithms learn to rank a set of items by optimizing a loss that is a function of the entire set—as a surrogate to a typically non-differentiable ranking metric. Despite their empirical success, existing listwise methods are based on heuristics and remain theoretically ill-understood. In particular, none of the empirically successful loss functions are related to ranking metrics. In this work, we propose a cross entropy-based learning-to-rank loss function that is theoretically sound, is a convex bound on NDCG—a popular ranking metric—and is consistent with NDCG under learning scenarios common in information retrieval. Furthermore, empirical evaluation of an implementation of the proposed method with gradient boosting machines on benchmark learning-to-rank datasets demonstrates the superiority of our proposed formulation over existing algorithms in quality and robustness.",7

A sequential process of selecting documents one-by-one is naturally modeled in learning-based approaches. However, such a process makes the learning difficult because there are an exponential number of ranking lists to consider. Sampling is usually used to reduce the computational complexity but this makes the learning less effective. In this paper, we propose a soft version of the “next document” paradigm in which we associate each document with an approximate rank, and thus the subtopics covered prior to a document can also be estimated. We show that we can derive differentiable diversification-aware losses, which are smooth approximation of diversity metrics like α-NDCG, based on these estimates. We further propose to optimize the losses in the learning-to-rank setting using neural distributed representations of queries and documents. Experiments are conducted on the public benchmark TREC datasets. By comparing with an extensive list of baseline methods, we show that our Diversification-Aware LEarning-TO-Rank (DALETOR) approaches outperform them by a large margin, while being much simpler during learning and inference.",3

Therefore, how to balance the relevance and fairness of information exposure is considered as one of the key problems for modern IR systems. As conventional ranking frameworks that myopically sorts documents with their relevance will inevitably introduce unfair result exposure, recent studies on ranking fairness mostly focus on dynamic ranking paradigms where result rankings can be adapted in real-time to support fairness in groups (i.e., races, genders, etc.). Existing studies on fairness in dynamic learning to rank, however, often achieve the overall fairness of document exposure in ranked lists by significantly sacrificing the performance of result relevance and fairness on the top results. To address this problem, we propose a fair and unbiased ranking method named Maximal Marginal Fairness (MMF). The algorithm integrates unbiased estimators for both relevance and merit-based fairness while providing an explicit controller that balances the selection of documents to maximize the marginal relevance and fairness in top-k results. Theoretical and empirical analysis shows that, with small compromises on long list fairness, our method achieves superior efficiency and effectiveness comparing to the state-of-the-art algorithms in both relevance and fairness for top-k rankings.",5

However, the required exploration drives it away from successful practices in offline learning to rank, which limits OL2R’s empirical performance and practical applicability. In this work, we propose to estimate a pairwise learning to rank model online. In each round, candidate documents are partitioned and ranked according to the model’s confidence on the estimated pairwise rank order, and exploration is only performed on the uncertain pairs of documents, i.e., divide-and-conquer. Regret directly defined on the number of mis-ordered pairs is proven, which connects the online solution’s theoretical convergence with its expected ranking performance. Comparisons against an extensive list of OL2R baselines on two public learning to rank benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.",3

LTR methods based on bandit algorithms often optimize tabular models that memorize the optimal ranking per query. These types of model have their own advantages and disadvantages. Feature-based models provide very robust performance across many queries, including those previously unseen, however, the available features often limit the rankings the model can predict. In contrast, tabular models can converge on any possible ranking through memorization. However, memorization is extremely prone to noise, which makes tabular models reliable only when large numbers of user interactions are available. Can we develop a robust counterfactual LTR method that pursues memorization-based optimization whenever it is safe to do?",2

Ho, ","Modern healthcare systems knitted by a web of entities (e.g., hospitals, clinics, pharmacy companies) are collecting a huge volume of healthcare data from a large number of individuals with various medical procedures, medications, diagnosis, and lab tests. To extract meaningful medical concepts (i.e., phenotypes) from such higher-arity relational healthcare data, tensor factorization has been proven to be an effective approach and received increasing research attention, due to their intrinsic capability to represent the high-dimensional data. Recently, federated learning offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for collaborative learning among different entities, which seemingly provides an ideal potential to further enhance the tensor factorization-based collaborative phenotyping to handle sensitive personal health data. However, existing attempts to federated tensor factorization come with various limitations, including restrictions to the classic tensor factorization, high communication cost and reduced accuracy. We propose a communication efficient federated generalized tensor factorization, which is flexible enough to choose from a variate of losses to best suit different types of data in practice. We design a three-level communication reduction strategy tailored to the generalized tensor factorization, which is able to reduce the uplink communication cost up to 99.90%. In addition, we theoretically prove that our algorithm does not compromise convergence speed despite the aggressive communication compression. Extensive experiments on two real-world electronics health record datasets demonstrate the efficiency improvements in terms of computation and communication cost.",3

Such datasets offer a great potential for enabling a better understanding of the health of populations, and inform health professionals and policy makers for better resource planning, disease management and prevention across different regions. However, due to the laborious and high-cost nature of collecting such public health data, it is a common place to find many missing entries on these datasets, which challenges the utility of the data and hinders reliable analysis and understanding. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a deep-learning-based approach, called Compressive Population Health (CPH), to infer and recover (to complete) the missing prevalence rate entries of multiple chronic diseases. The key insight of CPH relies on the combined exploitation of both intra-disease and inter-disease correlation opportunities. Specifically, we first propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach to extract and model both of these two types of correlations, and then adopt a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based prevalence inference model to jointly fuse them to facility the prevalence rates data recovery of missing entries. We extensively evaluate the inference model based on real-world public health datasets publicly available on the Web. Results show that our inference method outperforms other baseline methods in various settings and with a significantly improved accuracy (from 14.8% to 9.1%).",1

They commonly use the symptoms they are experiencing to identify the health conditions they may have (self-diagnosis task) as well as to determine an appropriate action to take (triaging task); e.g., should they seek emergent medical attention or attempt to treat themselves at home? This paper investigates the effectiveness of two of the most common methods people use for self-diagnosis and triaging: online symptom checkers and traditional web search engines. To this end, we conducted a user study with 64 real-world users performing 8 simulated self-diagnosis tasks. Participants were exposed to both a representative symptom checker and a search engine. The results of our study provides empirical evidence for whether using a search engine for health information improves people’s understanding of their health condition and their ability to act on them, compared to interacting with a symptom checker, which bases its interaction model on a question-answering process. Additionally, recorded answers to qualitative questionnaires from study participants provide insights into which style of interaction and system they prefer to use for obtaining medical information, and how helpful they thought each system was. These findings can help inform the development of better search engines and symptom checkers that support people seeking health advice online.",3

They are often driven by the same search intent and, hence, it is natural to jointly optimize both tasks. So far, most models proposed for jointly optimizing document reranking (DR) and NQP have focused on users’ short-term intent in an ongoing search session. Because of this limitation, these models fail to account for users’ long-term intent as captured in their historical search sessions. In contrast, we consider a personalized mechanism for learning a user’s profile from their long-term and short-term behavior to simultaneously enhance the performance of DR and NQP in an ongoing search session.",6

To date, however, little is known about the amount of traffic generated by Wikipedia’s external links. We fill this gap in a detailed analysis of usage logs gathered from Wikipedia users’ client devices. Our analysis proceeds in three steps: First, we quantify the level of engagement with external links, finding that, in one month, English Wikipedia generated 43M clicks to external websites, in roughly even parts via links in infoboxes, cited references, and article bodies. Official links listed in infoboxes have by far the highest click-through rate (CTR), 2.47% on average. In particular, official links associated with articles about businesses, educational institutions, and websites have the highest CTR, whereas official links associated with articles about geographical content, television, and music have the lowest CTR. Second, we investigate patterns of engagement with external links, finding that Wikipedia frequently serves as a stepping stone between search engines and third-party websites, effectively fulfilling information needs that search engines do not meet. Third, we quantify the hypothetical economic value of the clicks received by external websites from English Wikipedia, by estimating that the respective website owners would need to pay a total of $7–13 million per month to obtain the same volume of traffic via sponsored search. Overall, these findings shed light on Wikipedia’s role not only as an important source of information, but also as a high-traffic gateway to the broader Web ecosystem.",5

Object similarity can then be computed by learning binary representations (hash codes) of the objects and computing their Hamming distance. While this is highly efficient, each bit dimension is equally weighted, which means that potentially discriminative information of the data is lost. A more expressive alternative is to use real-valued vector representations and compute their inner product; this allows varying the weight of each dimension but is many magnitudes slower. To fix this, we derive a new way of measuring the dissimilarity between two objects in the Hamming space with binary weighting of each dimension (i.e., disabling bits): we consider a field-agnostic dissimilarity that projects the vector of one object onto the vector of the other. When working in the Hamming space, this results in a novel projected Hamming dissimilarity, which by choice of projection, effectively allows a binary importance weighting of the hash code of one object through the hash code of the other. We propose a variational hashing model for learning hash codes optimized for this projected Hamming dissimilarity, and experimentally evaluate it in collaborative filtering experiments. The resultant hash codes lead to effectiveness gains of up to +7% in NDCG and +14% in MRR compared to state-of-the-art hashing-based collaborative filtering baselines, while requiring no additional storage and no computational overhead compared to using the Hamming distance.",2

Among the tremendous efforts that aim to improve search performance with user behavior modeling, constructing click models is of vital importance because it provides a direct estimation of result relevance. Most existing click models assume that whether or not users click on results only depends on the examination probability and the content of the result. However, through a carefully designed user eye-tracking study, we found that users do not make click-through decisions in isolation. Instead, they also consider the context of a result (e.g., adjacent results). This finding leads to the design of a novel click model named Comparison-based Click Model (CBCM). Different from traditional examination hypotheses, CBCM introduces the concept of an examination viewport and assumes users click results after comparing adjacent results within the same viewport. The experimental results on a publicly available user behavior dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CBCM. We also public our code of CBCM and dataset.",2

However, today’s cloud datacenters have become more geographically spread, the bandwidth of the networks keeps increasing, pushing the end-users latency down. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive cloud reachability study as we perform extensive global client-to-cloud latency measurements towards 189 datacenters from all major cloud providers. We leverage the well-known measurement platform RIPE Atlas, involving up to 8500 probes deployed in heterogeneous environments, e.g., home and offices. Our goal is to evaluate the suitability of modern cloud environments for various current and predicted applications. We achieve this by comparing our latency measurements against known human perception thresholds and are able to draw inferences on the suitability of current clouds for novel applications, such as augmented reality. Our results indicate that the current cloud coverage can easily support several latency-critical applications, like cloud gaming, for the majority of the world’s population.",9

BBR solves the bufferbloat problem in legacy loss-based congestion control algorithms where application performance drops considerably when router buffers are deep. BBR regulates traffic such that router queues don’t build up to avoid the bufferbloat problem while still maintaining high throughput. However, our analysis shows that video applications experience significantly poor performance when using BBR under deep buffers. In fact, we find that video traffic sees inflated latencies because of long queues at the router, ultimately degrading video performance. To understand this dichotomy, we study the interaction between BBR and DASH video. Our investigation reveals that BBR under deep buffers and high network burstiness severely overestimates available bandwidth and does not converge to steady state, both of which results in BBR sending substantially more data into the network, causing a queue buildup. This elevated packet sending rate under BBR is ultimately caused by the router’s ability to absorb bursts in traffic, which destabilizes BBR’s bandwidth estimation and overrides BBR’s expected logic for exiting the startup phase. We design a new bandwidth estimation algorithm and apply it to BBR (and a still-unreleased, newer version of BBR called BBR2). Our modified BBR and BBR2 both see significantly improved video QoE even under deep buffers.",1

Most empirical studies of GNNs assume that the observed graph represents a complete and accurate picture of node relationship. However, this fundamental assumption cannot always be satisfied, since the real-world graphs from complex systems are error-prone and may not be compatible with the properties of GNNs. Therefore, GNNs solely relying on original graph may cause unsatisfactory results, one typical example of which is that GNNs perform well on graphs with homophily while fail on the disassortative situation. In this paper, we propose graph estimation neural networks GEN, which estimates graph structure for GNNs. Specifically, our GEN presents a structure model to fit the mechanism of GNNs by generating graphs with community structure, and an observation model that injects multifaceted observations into calculating the posterior distribution of graphs and is the first to incorporate multi-order neighborhood information. With above two models, the estimation of graph is implemented based on Bayesian inference to maximize the posterior probability, which attains mutual optimization with GNN parameters in an iterative framework. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of GEN, we perform a set of experiments on several benchmark datasets with different homophily and a synthetic dataset, where the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our GEN and rationality of the estimated graph.",6

A long-standing challenge in network analysis has been the relative scarcity of reasonable null models for networks; arguably the most common such model has been the configuration model, which starts with a graph G and produces a random graph with the same node degrees as G. This leads to a very weak form of null model, since fixing the node degrees does not preserve many of the crucial properties of the network, including the structure of its subgraphs.",2

However, most existing methods only consider simple, undirected, unweighted networks. Complex networks in the real-world often have rich information though: edges are asymmetrical and nodes/edges have categorical and numerical attributes. Finding dense subgraphs in such networks in accordance with this rich information is an important problem with many applications. Furthermore, most existing algorithms ignore the higher-order relationships (i.e., motifs) among the nodes. Motifs are shown to be helpful for dense subgraph discovery but their wide spectrum in heterogeneous networks makes it challenging to utilize them effectively. In this work, we propose quark decomposition framework to locate dense subgraphs that are rich with a given motif. We focus on networks with directed edges and categorical attributes on nodes/edges. For a given motif, our framework builds subgraphs, called quarks, in varying quality and with hierarchical relations. Our framework is versatile, efficient, and extendible. We discuss the limitations and practical instantiations of our framework as well as the role confusion problem that needs to be considered in directed networks. We give an extensive evaluation of our framework in directed, signed-directed, and node-labeled networks. We consider various motifs and evaluate the quark decomposition using several real-world networks. Results show that quark decomposition performs better than the state-of-the-art techniques.

Graph neural networks (GNNs), as powerful tools for graph data, have shown superior performance on network analysis. Recently, many excellent models have been proposed to process hetero-graph data using GNNs and have achieved great success. These GNN-based heterogeneous models can be interpreted as smooth node attributes guided by graph structure, which requires all nodes to have attributes. However, this is not easy to satisfy, as some types of nodes often have no attributes in heterogeneous graphs. Previous studies take some handcrafted methods to solve this problem, which separate the attribute completion from the graph learning process and, in turn, result in poor performance. In this paper, we hold that missing attributes can be acquired by a learnable manner, and propose a general framework for Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network via Attribute Completion (HGNN-AC), including pre-learning of topological embedding and attribute completion with attention mechanism. HGNN-AC first uses existing HIN-Embedding methods to obtain node topological embedding. Then it uses the topological relationship between nodes as guidance to complete attributes for no-attribute nodes by weighted aggregation of the attributes from these attributed nodes. Our complement mechanism can be easily combined with an arbitrary GNN-based heterogeneous model making the whole system end-to-end. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graphs. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art baselines.",14

In this paper, we aim at pushing the diversification to the upstream candidate generation stage, with the help of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Although GCN based recommendation algorithms have shown great power in modeling complex collaborative filtering effect to improve the accuracy of recommendation, how diversity changes is ignored in those advanced works.

Most existing social recommendation models exploit pairwise relations to mine potential user preferences. However, real-life interactions among users are very complex and user relations can be high-order. Hypergraph provides a natural way to model high-order relations, while its potentials for improving social recommendation are under-explored. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a multi-channel hypergraph convolutional network to enhance social recommendation by leveraging high-order user relations. Technically, each channel in the network encodes a hypergraph that depicts a common high-order user relation pattern via hypergraph convolution. By aggregating the embeddings learned through multiple channels, we obtain comprehensive user representations to generate recommendation results. However, the aggregation operation might also obscure the inherent characteristics of different types of high-order connectivity information. To compensate for the aggregating loss, we innovatively integrate self-supervised learning into the training of the hypergraph convolutional network to regain the connectivity information with hierarchical mutual information maximization. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the current SOTA methods, and the ablation study verifies the effectiveness and rationale of the multi-channel setting and the self-supervised task.

While many promising results have been achieved, existing models mostly simulate the environment reward with a unified value, which may hinder the understanding of users’ complex preferences and limit the model performance. In this paper, we consider how to model user multi-aspect preferences in the context of RL-based recommender system. More specifically, we base our model on the framework of deterministic policy gradient (DPG), which is effective in dealing with large action spaces. A major challenge for modeling user multi-aspect preferences lies in the fact that they may contradict with each other. To solve this problem, we introduce Pareto optimization into the DPG framework. We assign each aspect with a tailored critic, and all the critics share the same actor. The Pareto optimization is realized by a gradient-based method, which can be easily integrated into the actor and critic learning process. Based on the designed model, we theoretically analyze its gradient bias in the optimization process, and we design a weight-reuse mechanism to lower the upper bound of this bias, which is shown to be effective for improving the model performance.

In order to deal with the enormous combinatorial space of slates, recent work considers a generative solution so that a slate distribution can be directly modeled. However, we observe that such approaches—despite their proved effectiveness in computer vision—suffer from a trade-off dilemma in recommender systems: when focusing on reconstruction, they easily over-fit the data and hardly generate satisfactory recommendations; on the other hand, when focusing on satisfying the user interests, they get trapped in a few items and fail to cover the item variation in slates. In this paper, we propose to enhance the accuracy-based evaluation with slate variation metrics to estimate the stochastic behavior of generative models. We illustrate that instead of reaching to one of the two undesirable extreme cases in the dilemma, a valid generative solution resides in a narrow “elbow” region in between. And we show that item perturbation can enforce slate variation and mitigate the over-concentration of generated slates, which expand the “elbow” performance to an easy-to-find region. We further propose to separate a pivot selection phase from the generation process so that the model can apply perturbation before generation. Empirical results show that this simple modification can provide even better variance with the same level of accuracy compared to post-generation perturbation methods.",3

Models based on deep learning and attention mechanism have achieved good performance in sequential recommendation. Recently, the generative models based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) have shown the unique advantage in collaborative filtering. In particular, the sequential VAE model as a recurrent version of VAE can effectively capture temporal dependencies among items in user sequence and perform sequential recommendation. However, VAE-based models suffer from a common limitation that the representational ability of the obtained approximate posterior distribution is limited, resulting in lower quality of generated samples. This is especially true for generating sequences. To solve the above problem, in this work, we propose a novel method called Adversarial and Contrastive Variational Autoencoder (ACVAE) for sequential recommendation. Specifically, we first introduce the adversarial training for sequence generation under the Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB) framework, which enables our model to generate high-quality latent variables. Then, we employ the contrastive loss. The latent variables will be able to learn more personalized and salient characteristics by minimizing the contrastive loss. Besides, when encoding the sequence, we apply a recurrent and convolutional structure to capture global and local relationships in the sequence. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed ACVAE model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",9

To combat this problem, secure protocols have been used to encrypt DNS messages. Existing studies have investigated the performance overhead and privacy benefits of encrypted DNS communications, yet little has been done from the perspective of censorship. In this paper, we study the impact of the encrypted DNS on Internet censorship in two aspects. On one hand, we explore the severity of DNS manipulation, which could be leveraged for Internet censorship, given the use of encrypted DNS resolvers. In particular, we perform 7.4 million DNS lookup measurements on 3,813 DoT and 75 DoH resolvers and identify that 1.66% of DoT responses and 1.42% of DoH responses undergo DNS manipulation. More importantly, we observe that more than two-thirds of the DoT and DoH resolvers manipulate DNS responses from at least one domain, indicating that the DNS manipulation is prevalent in encrypted DNS, which can be further exploited for enhancing Internet censorship. On the other hand, we evaluate the effectiveness of using encrypted DNS resolvers for censorship circumvention. Specifically, we first discover those vantage points that involve DNS manipulation through on-path devices, and then we apply encrypted DNS resolvers at these vantage points to access the censored domains. We reveal that 37% of the domains are accessible from the vantage points in China, but none of the domains is accessible from the vantage points in Iran, indicating that the censorship circumvention of using encrypted DNS resolvers varies from country to country. Moreover, for a vantage point, using a different encrypted DNS resolver does not lead to a noticeable difference in accessing the censored domains.",5

Despite the significant progress made thus far, the focus of most existing work on cyberbullying detection lies in the independent content analysis of different comments within a social media session. We argue that such leading notions of analysis suffer from three key limitations: they overlook the temporal correlations among different comments; they only consider the content within a single comment rather than the topic coherence across comments; they remain generic and exploit limited interactions between social media users. In this work, we observe that user comments in the same session may be inherently related, e.g., discussing similar topics, and their interaction may evolve over time. We also show that modeling such topic coherence and temporal interaction are critical to capture the repetitive characteristics of bullying behavior, thus leading to better predicting performance. To achieve the goal, we first construct a unified temporal graph for each social media session. Drawing on recent advances in graph neural network, we then propose a principled graph-based approach for modeling the temporal dynamics and topic coherence throughout user interactions. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach with the tasks of session-level bullying detection and comment-level case study. Our code is released to public. 1",3

In Dr.Emotion, for given social media posts, we first post-train a transformer-based model to obtain the initial post embeddings. Since users may implicitly express their emotions in social media posts which could be highly entangled with other descriptive information in the post content, to address this challenge for emotion analysis, we propose an adversarial disentangler by integrating emotion-independent (i.e., sentiment-neutral) priors of the posts generated by another post-trained transformer-based model to separate and disentangle the implicitly encoded emotions from the content in latent space for emotion classification at the first attempt. Extensive experimental studies are conducted to fully evaluate Dr.Emotion and promising results demonstrate its performance in emotion analysis by comparison with the state-of-the-art baseline methods.

To mitigate large-scale annotations on the target domain, domain adaptation (DA) provides an alternate solution by learning a transferable model from other labeled source domains. Existing multi-source domain adaptation (MDA) methods either fail to extract some discriminative features in the target domain that are related to sentiment, neglect the correlations of different sources and the distribution difference among different sub-domains even in the same source, or cannot reflect the varying optimal weighting during different training stages. In this paper, we propose a novel instance-level MDA framework, named curriculum cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (C-CycleGAN), to address the above issues. Specifically, C-CycleGAN consists of three components: (1) pre-trained text encoder which encodes textual input from different domains into a continuous representation space, (2) intermediate domain generator with curriculum instance-level adaptation which bridges the gap across source and target domains, and (3) task classifier trained on the intermediate domain for final sentiment classification. C-CycleGAN transfers source samples at instance-level to an intermediate domain that is closer to the target domain with sentiment semantics preserved and without losing discriminative features. Further, our dynamic instance-level weighting mechanisms can assign the optimal weights to different source samples in each training stage.

It is possible much of lexical diffusion happens via the changing rates of existing word categories or concepts (those that are already being used, at least to some extent, regularly) rather than new ones. In this study we introduce a new metric, contrastive lexical diffusion (CLD) coefficient, which attempts to measure the degree to which ordinary language (here clusters of common words) catch on over friendship connections over time. For instance topics related to meeting and job are found to be sticky, while negative thinking and emotion, and global events, like ‘school orientation’ were found to be less sticky even though they change rates over time. We evaluate CLD coefficient over both quantitative and qualitative tests, studied over 6 years of language on Twitter. We find CLD predicts the spread of tweets and friendship connections, scores converge with human judgments of lexical diffusion (r=0.92), and CLD coefficients replicate across disjoint networks (r=0.85). Comparing CLD scores can help understand lexical diffusion: positive emotion words appear more diffusive than negative emotions, first-person plurals (we) score higher than other pronouns, and numbers and time appear non-contagious.",0

In contrast, some of the best-performing collaborative filtering models today are high-dimensional linear models that do not rely on factorization, and so they do not produce embeddings [27, 28]. They also require pruning, amounting to a trade-off between the model size and the density of the predicted affinities. This paper argues for the use of high-dimensional, sparse latent factor models, instead. We propose a new recommendation model based on a full-rank factorization of the inverse Gram matrix.

While people have been trying to develop solutions for providing some of the above abilities, there is no total solution or complete framework to integrate all these abilities together. To this end, in this paper, we propose a unified time-aware career trajectory prediction framework, namely TACTP, which is capable of jointly providing the above three abilities for better understanding the career trajectories of talents. Along this line, we first exploit a hierarchical deep sequential modeling network for career embedding and extract latent talent factors from multiple networks, which are designed with different functions of handling related issues of the timing, companies, and positions for job-hopping. Then, we perform collaborative filtering for generating personalized predictions. Furthermore, we propose a temporal encoding mechanism to handle dynamic temporal information so that TACTP is capable of generating time-aware predictions by addressing the challenges for variable interval time sequence modeling. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on large-scale real-world data to evaluate TACTP against the state-of-the-art baselines, and the results show that TACTP has advantages over baselines on all targeted tasks for career trajectory prediction.",4

However, recent studies have pointed out that captioning datasets, such as COCO, contain gender bias found in web corpora. As a result, learning models could heavily rely on the learned priors and image context for gender identification, leading to incorrect or even offensive errors. To encourage models to learn correct gender features, we reorganize the COCO dataset and present two new splits COCO-GB V1 and V2 datasets where the train and test sets have different gender-context joint distribution. Models relying on contextual cues will suffer from huge gender prediction errors on the anti-stereotypical test data. Benchmarking experiments reveal that most captioning models learn gender bias, leading to high gender prediction errors, especially for women. To alleviate the unwanted bias, we propose a new Guided Attention Image Captioning model (GAIC) which provides self-guidance on visual attention to encourage the model to capture correct gender visual evidence. Experimental results validate that GAIC can significantly reduce gender prediction errors with a competitive caption quality.

In this paper, we seek to inform the design of these systems by examining how individuals make sense of fairness issues as they use different de-biasing affordances. In particular, we consider the tension between de-biasing recommendations which are quick but may lack nuance and ”what-if” style exploration which is time consuming but may lead to deeper understanding and transferable insights. Using logs, think-aloud data, and semi-structured interviews we find that exploratory systems promote a rich pattern of hypothesis generation and testing, while recommendations deliver quick answers which satisfy participants at the cost of reduced information exposure. We highlight design requirements and trade-offs in the design of ML fairness systems to promote accurate and explainable assessments.",0

Discerning this subset is the key problem of this work. We formulate this problem as a gradient-based perturbation maximization method that discovers this subset in the input feature space with respect to the functionality of the prediction model used by the provider. After identifying the subset, our framework, Cloak, suppresses the rest of the features using utility-preserving constant values that are discovered through a separate gradient-based optimization process. We show that Cloak does not necessarily require collaboration from the service provider beyond its normal service, and can be applied in scenarios where we only have black-box access to the service provider’s model. We theoretically guarantee that Cloak’s optimizations reduce the upper bound of the Mutual Information (MI) between the data and the sifted representations that are sent out. Experimental results show that Cloak reduces the mutual information between the input and the sifted representations by 85.01% with only negligible reduction in utility (1.42%). In addition, we show that Cloak greatly diminishes adversaries’ ability to learn and infer non-conducive features.",4

These networks typically contain informative while subtle patterns that reflect people’s social characters and relationship, and therefore attract the attentions of a lot of social scientists and computer scientists. Previous approaches on extracting those patterns primarily rely on sophisticated expert knowledge of psychology and social science, and the obtained features are often overly task-specific. More generic models based on representation learning of dynamic networks may be applied, but the unique properties of social interactions cause severe model mismatch and degenerate the quality of the obtained representations. Here we fill this gap by proposing a novel framework, termed TEmporal network-DIffusion Convolutional networks (TEDIC), for generic representation learning on dynamic social interaction networks. We make TEDIC a good fit by designing two components: 1) Adopt diffusion of node attributes over a combination of the original network and its complement to capture long-hop interactive patterns embedded in the behaviors of people making or avoiding contact; 2) Leverage temporal convolution networks with hierarchical set-pooling operation to flexibly extract patterns from different-length interactions scattered over a long time span. The design also endows TEDIC with certain self-explaining power. We evaluate TEDIC over five real datasets for four different social character prediction tasks including deception detection, dominance identification, nervousness detection and community detection. TEDIC not only consistently outperforms previous SOTA’s, but also provides two important pieces of social insight. In addition, it exhibits favorable societal characteristics by remaining unbiased to people from different regions. Our project website is: http://snap.stanford.edu/tedic/.",3

However, due to their complex modeling of temporal dependencies, MHPs have proven to be notoriously difficult to scale, what has limited their applications to relatively small domains. In this work, we propose a novel model and computational approach to overcome this important limitation. By exploiting a characteristic sparsity pattern in real-world diffusion processes, we show that our approach allows to compute the exact likelihood and gradients of an MHP – independently of the ambient dimensions of the underlying network. We show on synthetic and real-world datasets that our method does not only achieve state-of-the-art modeling results, but also improves runtime performance by multiple orders of magnitude on sparse event sequences. In combination with easily interpretable latent variables and influence structures, this allows us to analyze diffusion processes in networks at previously unattainable scale.",0

In spite of this, there are few generative graph models that consider higher-order network structures and even fewer that focus on using motifs in models of dynamic graphs. Most existing generative models for temporal graphs strictly grow the networks via edge addition, and the models are evaluated using static graph structure metrics—which do not adequately capture the temporal behavior of the network. To address these issues, in this work we propose DYnamic MOtif-NoDes (DYMOND)—a generative model that considers (i) the dynamic changes in overall graph structure using temporal motif activity and (ii) the roles nodes play in motifs (e.g., one node plays the hub role in a wedge, while the remaining two act as spokes). We compare DYMOND to three dynamic graph generative model baselines on real-world networks and show that DYMOND performs better at generating graph structure and node behavior similar to the observed network. We also propose a new methodology to adapt graph structure metrics to better evaluate the temporal aspect of the network. These metrics take into account the changes in overall graph structure and the individual nodes’ behavior over time.",1

Graph structures among time series are found in diverse domains, such as web traffic influenced by hyperlinks, product sales influenced by recommendation, or urban transport volume influenced by road networks and weather. There has been recent progress in graph modeling and in time series forecasting, respectively, but an expressive and scalable approach for a network of series does not yet exist. We introduce Radflow, a novel model that embodies three key ideas: a recurrent neural network to obtain node embeddings that depend on time, the aggregation of the flow of influence from neighboring nodes with multi-head attention, and the multi-layer decomposition of time series. Radflow naturally takes into account dynamic networks where nodes and edges change over time, and it can be used for prediction and data imputation tasks. On real-world datasets ranging from a few hundred to a few hundred thousand nodes, we observe that Radflow variants are the best performing model across a wide range of settings. The recurrent component in Radflow also outperforms N-BEATS, the state-of-the-art time series model. We show that Radflow can learn different trends and seasonal patterns, that it is robust to missing nodes and edges, and that correlated temporal patterns among network neighbors reflect influence strength. We curate WikiTraffic, the largest dynamic network of time series with 366K nodes and 22M time-dependent links spanning five years. This dataset provides an open benchmark for developing models in this area, with applications that include optimizing resources for the web. More broadly, Radflow has the potential to improve forecasts in correlated time series networks such as the stock market, and impute missing measurements in geographically dispersed networks of natural phenomena.",4

While search request becomes complex and exploratory, many search sessions contain more than a single query thus reformulation becomes a necessity. To help users better formulate their queries in these complex search tasks, modern search engines usually provide a series of reformulation entries on search engine result pages (SERPs), i.e., query suggestions and related entities. However, few existing work have thoroughly studied why and how users perform query reformulations in these heterogeneous interfaces. Therefore, whether search engines provide sufficient assistance for users in reformulating queries remains under-investigated. To shed light on this research question, we conducted a field study to analyze fine-grained user reformulation behaviors including reformulation type, entry, reason, and the inspiration source with various search intents. Different from existing efforts that rely on external assessors to make judgments, in the field study we collect both implicit behavior signals and explicit user feedback information. Analysis results demonstrate that query reformulation behavior in Web search varies with the type of search tasks. We also found that the current query suggestion/related query recommendations provided by search engines do not offer enough help for users in complex search tasks. Based on the findings in our field study, we design a supervised learning framework to predict: 1) the reason behind each query reformulation, and 2) how users organize the reformulated query, both of which are novel challenges in this domain. This work provides insight into complex query reformulation behavior in Web search as well as the guidance for designing better query suggestion techniques in search engines.",5

However, existing retrieval models mainly focus on semantic similarity and cognitive relevance while ignore other possible dimensions to model relevance. Topical relatedness, as an important dimension to measure relevance, is not well studied in existing neural information retrieval. In this paper, we propose a Topic Enhanced Knowledge-aware retrieval Model (TEKM) that jointly learns semantic similarity, knowledge relevance and topical relatedness to estimate relevance between query and document. We first construct a neural topic model to learn topical information and generate topic embeddings of a query. Then we combine the topic embeddings with a knowledge-aware retrieval model to estimate different dimensions of relevance. Specifically, we exploit kernel pooling to soft match topic embeddings with word and entity in a unified embedding space to generate fine-grained topical relatedness. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on a large-scale publicly available benchmark dataset show that TEKM outperforms existing retrieval models. Further analysis also shows how topic relatedness is modeled to improve traditional retrieval model with semantic similarity and knowledge relevance.",0

We define the problem as retrieving a sequence of items with a gradual change on a certain attribute, given a reference item and a modification text. For example, after a customer saw a white dress, she/he wants to buy a similar one but more floral on it. The extent of ”more floral” is subjective, thus prompting one floral dress is hard to satisfy the customer’s needs. A better way is to present a sequence of products with increasingly floral attributes based on the white dress, and allow the customer to select the most satisfactory one from the sequence. Existing item retrieval methods mainly focus on whether the target items appear at the top of the retrieved sequence, but ignore the demand for retrieving a sequence of products with gradual change on a certain attribute. To deal with this problem, we propose a weakly-supervised method that can learn a disentangled item representation from user-item interaction data and ground the semantic meaning of attributes to dimensions of the item representation. Our method takes a reference item and a modification as a query. During inference, we start from the reference item and ”walk” along the direction of the modification in the item representation space to retrieve a sequence of items in a gradient manner. We demonstrate our proposed method can achieve disentanglement through weak supervision. Besides, we empirically show that an item sequence retrieved by our method is gradually changed on an indicated attribute and, in the item retrieval task, our method outperforms existing approaches on three different datasets.",2

To solve the problem, we explicitly model the document-level word relationship through the graph structure, capturing the subtle information via graph neural networks. In addition, due to the complexity and scale of the document collections, it is considerable to explore the different grain-sized hierarchical matching signals at a more general level. Therefore, we propose a Graph-based Hierarchical Relevance Matching model (GHRM) for ad-hoc retrieval, by which we can capture the subtle and general hierarchical matching signals simultaneously.

Most existing click models are based on the examination hypothesis in user behaviors and differ in how to model such an examination bias. However, they are constrained by assuming a simple position-based bias or enforcing a sequential order in user examination behaviors. These assumptions are insufficient to capture complex real-world user behaviors and hardly generalize to modern user interfaces (UI) in web applications (e.g., results shown in a grid view). In this work, we propose a fully data-driven neural model for the examination bias, Cross-Positional Attention (XPA), which is more flexible in fitting complex user behaviors. Our model leverages the attention mechanism to effectively capture cross-positional interactions among displayed items and is applicable to arbitrary UIs. We employ XPA in a novel neural click model that can both predict clicks and estimate relevance. Our experiments on offline synthetic data sets show that XPA is robust among different click generation processes. We further apply XPA to a large-scale real-world recommender system, showing significantly better results than baselines in online A/B experiments that involve millions of users.

Rivero, ","Completion methods learn models to infer missing (subject, predicate, object) triples in knowledge graphs, a task known as link prediction. The training phase is based on samples of positive triples and their negative counterparts. The test phase consists of ranking each positive triple with respect to its negative counterparts based on the scores obtained by a learned model. The best model ranks all positive triples first. Metrics like mean rank, mean reciprocal rank and hits at k are used to assess accuracy. Under this generic evaluation protocol, we observe several shortcomings: 1) Current metrics assume that each measurement is upper bounded by the same constant value and, therefore, are oblivious to the fact that, in link prediction, each positive triple may have a different number of negative counterparts, which alters the difficulty of ranking positive triples. 2) Benchmarking datasets contain anomalies (unrealistic redundancy) that allegedly simplifies link prediction; however, current instantiations of the generic evaluation protocol do not integrate anomalies, which are just discarded based on a user-defined threshold. 3) Benchmarking datasets have been randomly split, which typically alters the graph topology and results in the training split not resembling the original dataset. 4) A single model is typically kept based on its accuracy over the validation split using a given metric; however, since metrics aggregate ranks into a single value, there may be no significant differences among the ranks produced by several models, which must be all evaluated in the test phase. In this paper, we contribute to the evaluation of link prediction as follows: 1) We propose a variation of the mean rank that considers the number of negative counterparts. 2) We define the anomaly coefficient of a predicate and integrate such coefficient in the protocol. 3) We propose a downscaling algorithm to generate training splits that reflect the original graph topology based on a nonparametric, unpaired statistical test. 4) During validation, we discard a learned model only if its output ranks are significantly different than other ranks based on a nonparametric, paired statistical test. Our experiments over seven well-known datasets show that translation-based methods (TransD, TransE and TransH) significantly outperform recent methods, which entails that our understanding of the accuracy of completion methods for link prediction is far from perfect.",1

We believe over-complex graph encoder and inefficient negative sampling strategy are the two main reasons. In this paper, we propose a novel KG encoder — Dual Attention Matching Network (Dual-AMN), which not only models both intra-graph and cross-graph information smartly, but also greatly reduces computational complexity. Furthermore, we propose the Normalized Hard Sample Mining Loss to smoothly select hard negative samples with reduced loss shift. The experimental results on widely used public datasets indicate that our method achieves both high accuracy and high efficiency. On DWY100K, the whole running process of our method could be finished in 1,100 seconds, at least 10 × faster than previous work.

A fact in a KG is represented as a triplet (h, r, t) linking two entities h and t via a relation r. Existing work mostly consider link prediction to solve this problem, i.e., given two elements of a triplet predicting the missing one, such as (h, r, ?). This task has, however, a strong assumption on the two given elements in a triplet, which have to be correlated, resulting otherwise in meaningless predictions, such as (Marie Curie, headquarters location, ?). In addition, the KG completion problem has also been formulated as a relation prediction task, i.e., when predicting relations r for a given entity h. Without predicting t, this task is however a step away from the ultimate goal of KG completion. Against this background, this paper studies an instance completion task suggesting r-t pairs for a given h, i.e., (h, ?, ?). We propose an end-to-end solution called RETA (as it suggests the Relation and Tail for a given head entity) consisting of two components: a RETA-Filter and RETA-Grader. More precisely, our RETA-Filter first generates candidate r-t pairs for a given h by extracting and leveraging the schema of a KG; our RETA-Grader then evaluates and ranks the candidate r-t pairs considering the plausibility of both the candidate triplet and its corresponding schema using a newly-designed KG embedding model. We evaluate our methods against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on three real-world KG datasets. Results show that our RETA-Filter generates of high-quality candidate r-t pairs, outperforming the best baseline techniques while reducing by 10.61%-84.75% the candidate size under the same candidate quality guarantees.

However, to date, these studies have not focused explicitly on context-driven interaction that underlies the typical use of more pervasive Question Answering (QA) focused conversational assistants like Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Google Assistant. In this paper, we aim to understand a general workflow of natural context-driven conversational recommendation that arises from a pairwise study of a human user interacting with a human simulating the role of a recommender. In our analysis of this intrinsically organic human-to-human conversation, we observe a clear structure of interaction workflow consisting of a preference elicitation and refinement stage, followed by inquiry and critiquing stages after the first recommendation. To better understand the nature of these stages and the conversational flow within them, we augment existing taxonomies of intent and action to label all interactions at each stage and analyze the workflow. From this analysis, we identify distinct conversational characteristics of each stage, e.g., (i) the preference elicitation stage consists of significant iteration to clarify, refine, and obtain a mutual understanding of preferences, (ii) the inquiry and critiquing stage consists of extensive informational queries to understand features of the recommended item and to (implicitly) specify critiques, and (iii) explanation appears to drive a substantial portion of the post-recommendation interaction, suggesting that beyond the purpose of justification, explanation serves a critical role to direct the evolving conversation itself. Altogether, we contribute a novel qualitative and quantitative analysis of workflow in conversational recommendation that further refines our existing understanding of this important frontier of conversational systems and suggests a number of critical avenues for further research to better automate natural recommendation conversations.",1

Such approaches have proven to be an important building block for recommendation tasks. However, existing distribution-aware approaches enforce that the target taste distribution should exactly match a user’s prior interests (typically revealed through training data), based on the assumption that users’ taste distribution is fundamentally static. This assumption can lead to large estimation errors. We empirically identify this taste distortion problem through a data-driven study over multiple datasets.

To address the issue, this paper proposes DeepRec, an on-device deep learning framework of mining interaction behaviors for sequential recommendation without sending any raw data or intermediate results out of the device, preserving user privacy maximally. DeepRec constructs a global model using data collected before GDPR and fine-tunes a personal model continuously on individual mobile devices using data collected after GDPR. DeepRec employs the model pruning and embedding sparsity techniques to reduce the computation and network overhead, making the model training process practical on computation-constraint mobile devices. Evaluation results show that DeepRec can achieve comparable recommendation accuracy to existing centralized recommendation approaches with small computation overhead and up to 10x reduction in network overhead.",2

However, the rise of data regulatory constraints precludes collecting private and labeled signal data from personal devices at scale. Thanks to the growth of computational power on mobile devices, federated learning has emerged as a decentralized alternative solution to model training, which iteratively aggregates locally updated models into a shared global model, therefore being able to leverage decentralized, private data without central collection. However, the effectiveness of federated learning for HAR is affected by the fact that each user has different activity types and even a different signal distribution for the same activity type. Furthermore, it is uncertain if a single global model trained can generalize well to individual users or new users with heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Meta-HAR, a federated representation learning framework, in which a signal embedding network is meta-learned in a federated manner, while the learned signal representations are further fed into a personalized classification network at each user for activity prediction. In order to boost the representation ability of the embedding network, we treat the HAR problem at each user as a different task and train the shared embedding network through a Model-Agnostic Meta-learning framework, such that the embedding network can generalize to any individual user. Personalization is further achieved on top of the robustly learned representations in an adaptation procedure. We conducted extensive experiments based on two publicly available HAR datasets as well as a newly created HAR dataset. Results verify that Meta-HAR is effective at maintaining high test accuracies for individual users, including new users, and significantly outperforms several baselines, including Federated Averaging, Reptile and even centralized learning in certain cases. Our collected dataset will be open-sourced to facilitate future development in the field of sensor-based human activity recognition.",7

After learning, the resulting federated model should be further personalized to each different client. While several methods have been proposed to achieve personalization, they are typically limited to a single local device, which may incur bias or overfitting since data in a single device is extremely limited. In this paper, we attempt to realize personalization beyond a single client. The motivation is that during the FL process, there may exist many clients with similar data distribution, and thus the personalization performance could be significantly boosted if these similar clients can cooperate with each other. Inspired by this, this paper introduces a new concept called federated adaptation, targeting at adapting the trained model in a federated manner to achieve better personalization results. However, the key challenge for federated adaptation is that we could not outsource any raw data from the client during adaptation, due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose PFA, a framework to accomplish Privacy-preserving Federated Adaptation. PFA leverages the sparsity property of neural networks to generate privacy-preserving representations and uses them to efficiently identify clients with similar data distributions. Based on the grouping results, PFA conducts an FL process in a group-wise way on the federated model to accomplish the adaptation. For evaluation, we manually construct several practical FL datasets based on public datasets in order to simulate both the class-imbalance and background-difference conditions. Extensive experiments on these datasets and popular model architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of PFA, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin while ensuring user privacy. We will release our code at: https://github.com/lebyni/PFA.",2

However, there are relatively few studies on incentive mechanisms. Most studies fail to consider the fact that if there is no profit, participants have no incentive to provide data and training models, and task requesters cannot identify and select reliable participants with high-quality data. Therefore, this paper proposes a federated learning incentive mechanism based on reputation and reverse auction theory. Participants bid for tasks, and reputation indirectly reflects their reliability and data quality. In this federated learning program, we select and reward participants by combining the reputation and bids of the participants under a limited budget. Theoretical analysis proves that the mechanism satisfies computational efficiency, individual rationality, budget feasibility, and truthfulness. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the mechanism.",8

Usually, centralized user modeling suffers from the risk of privacy leakage. Instead, federated user modeling expects to provide a secure multi-client collaboration for user modeling through federated learning. Existing federated learning methods are mainly designed for consistent clients, which cannot be directly applied to practical scenarios, where different clients usually store inconsistent user data. Therefore, it is a crucial demand to design an appropriate federated solution that can better adapt to user modeling tasks, and however, meets following critical challenges: 1) Statistical heterogeneity. The distributions of user data in different clients are not always independently identically distributed which leads to personalized clients; 2) Privacy heterogeneity. User data contains both public and private information, which have different levels of privacy. It means we should balance different information to be shared and protected; 3) Model heterogeneity. The local user models trained with client records are heterogeneous which need flexible aggregation in the server. In this paper, we propose a novel client-server architecture framework, namely Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning (HPFL) to serve federated learning in user modeling with inconsistent clients. In the framework, we first define hierarchical information to finely partition the data with privacy heterogeneity. On this basis, the client trains a user model which contains different components designed for hierarchical information. Moreover, client processes a fine-grained personalized update strategy to update personalized user model for statistical heterogeneity. Correspondingly, the server completes a differentiated component aggregation strategy to flexibly aggregate heterogeneous user models in the case of privacy and model heterogeneity. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the HPFL framework.",4

Crowdsourcing aims to address this challenge via aggregating and estimating high-quality data (e.g., sentiment label for text) from pervasive clients/users. Existing studies on crowdsourcing focus on designing new methods to improve the aggregated data quality from unreliable/noisy clients. However, the security aspects of such crowdsourcing systems remain under-explored to date. We aim to bridge this gap in this work. Specifically, we show that crowdsourcing is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, in which malicious clients provide carefully crafted data to corrupt the aggregated data. We formulate our proposed data poisoning attacks as an optimization problem that maximizes the error of the aggregated data. Our evaluation results on one synthetic and two real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed attacks can substantially increase the estimation errors of the aggregated data. We also propose two defenses to reduce the impact of malicious clients. Our empirical results show that the proposed defenses can substantially reduce the estimation errors of the data poisoning attacks.",3

Recently, researchers in academia and industry have contributed several (self-created) benchmark deepfake datasets, and deepfake detection algorithms. However, little effort has gone towards understanding deepfake videos in the wild, leading to a limited understanding of the real-world applicability of research contributions in this space. Even if detection schemes are shown to perform well on existing datasets, it is unclear how well the methods generalize to real-world deepfakes. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we make the following contributions: First, we collect and present the largest dataset of deepfake videos in the wild, containing 1,869 videos from YouTube and Bilibili, and extract over 4.8M frames of content. Second, we present a comprehensive analysis of the growth patterns, popularity, creators, manipulation strategies, and production methods of deepfake content in the real-world.

These services are popular in part due to their light-weight nature and flexibility in scheduling and cost, however the security issues associated with serverless computing are not well understood. In this work, we explore the feasibility of constructing a practical covert channel from lambdas. We establish that a fast co-residence detection for lambdas is key to enabling such a covert channel, and proceed to develop a reliable and scalable co-residence detector based on the memory bus hardware. Our technique enables dynamic discovery for co-resident lambdas and is incredibly fast, executing in a matter of seconds. We evaluate our approach for correctness and scalability, and use it to establish covert channels and perform data transfer on AWS lambdas. We show that we can establish hundreds of individual covert channels for every 1000 lambdas deployed, and each of those channels can send data at a rate of 00 bits per second, thus demonstrating that covert communication via lambdas is entirely feasible.",2

Specifically, mobile users worry about their input data being labeled to secretly train new deep learning models that are unrelated to the DLIS they subscribe to. This unique issue, unlike the privacy problem, is about the rights of data owners in the context of deep learning. However, preventing data abuse is demanding when considering the usability and generality in the mobile scenario. In this work, we propose, to our best knowledge, the first data abuse prevention mechanism called DAPter. DAPter is a user-side DLIS-input converter, which removes unnecessary information with respect to the targeted DLIS. The converted input data by DAPter maintains good inference accuracy and is difficult to be labeled manually or automatically for the new model training. DAPter’s conversion is empowered by our lightweight generative model trained with a novel loss function to minimize abusable information in the input data. Furthermore, adapting DAPter requires no change in the existing DLIS backend and models. We conduct comprehensive experiments with our DAPter prototype on mobile devices and demonstrate that DAPter can substantially raise the bar of the data abuse difficulty with little impact on the service quality and overhead.",0

In this paper, we introduce two novel retrieval-oriented pretraining tasks to further pretrain cross-lingual language models for downstream retrieval tasks such as cross-lingual ad-hoc retrieval (CLIR) and cross-lingual question answering (CLQA). We construct distant supervision data from multilingual Wikipedia using section alignment to support retrieval-oriented language model pretraining. We also propose to directly finetune language models on part of the evaluation collection by making Transformers capable of accepting longer sequences.

A match plan is composed of a sequence of match rules, which contain discrete match rule types and continuous stopping quotas. Currently, match plans are manually designed by experts according to their several years’ experience, which encounters difficulty in dealing with heterogeneous queries and varying data distribution. In this work, we formulate the match plan generation as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with a parameterized action space, and propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm Parameterized Action Soft Actor-Critic (PASAC) to effectively enhance the exploration in both spaces. In our scene, we also discover a skew prioritizing issue of the original Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) and introduce Stratified Prioritized Experience Replay (SPER) to address it. We are the first group to generalize this task for all queries as a learning problem with zero prior knowledge and successfully apply deep reinforcement learning in the real web search environment. Our approach greatly outperforms the well-designed production match plans by over 70% reduction of index block accesses with the quality of documents almost unchanged, and 9% reduction of query response time even with model inference cost.

The definition and the modeling of relevance has always been critical challenges in both information science and computer science research areas. Along with the debate and exploration on relevance, IR has already become a core task in many real-world applications, such as Web search engines, question answering systems, conversational bots, and so on. While relevance acts as a unified concept in all these retrieval tasks, the inherent definitions are quite different due to the heterogeneity of these tasks. This raises a question to us: Do these different forms of relevance really lead to different modeling focuses? To answer this question, in this work, we conduct an empirical study on relevance modeling in three representative IR tasks, i.e., document retrieval, answer retrieval, and response retrieval. Specifically, we attempt to study the following two questions: 1) Does relevance modeling in these tasks really show differences in terms of natural language understanding (NLU)? We employ 16 linguistic tasks to probe a unified retrieval model over these three retrieval tasks to answer this question. 2) If there do exist differences, how can we leverage the findings to enhance the relevance modeling? We proposed three intervention methods to investigate how to leverage different modeling focuses of relevance to improve these IR tasks. We believe the way we study the problem as well as our findings would be beneficial to the IR community.",0

In order to address this problem, we propose a sampling strategy and estimation technique for four fair ranking metrics. We formulate a robust and unbiased estimator which can operate even with very limited number of labeled items. We evaluate our approach using both simulated and real world data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method can estimate this family of fair ranking metrics and provides a robust, reliable alternative to exhaustive or random data annotation.",1

In XEL, entity candidate retrieval needs to retrieve a list of plausible candidate entities from a large knowledge graph in a target language given a piece of text in a sentence or question, namely a mention, in a source language. Existing works mainly fall into two categories: lexicon-based and semantic-based approaches. The lexicon-based approach usually creates cross-lingual and mention-entity lexicons, which is effective but relies heavily on bilingual resources (e.g. inter-language links in Wikipedia). The semantic-based approach maps mentions and entities in different languages to a unified embedding space, which reduces dependence on large-scale bilingual dictionaries. However, its effectiveness is limited by the representation capacity of fixed-length vectors. In this paper, we propose a pivot-based approach which inherits the advantages of the aforementioned two approaches while avoiding their limitations. It takes an intermediary set of plausible target-language mentions as pivots to bridge the two types of gaps: cross-lingual gap and mention-entity gap. Specifically, it first converts mentions in the source language into an intermediary set of plausible mentions in the target language by cross-lingual semantic retrieval and a selective mechanism, and then retrieves candidate entities based on the generated mentions by lexical retrieval. The proposed approach only relies on a small bilingual word dictionary, and fully exploits the benefits of both lexical and semantic matching. Experimental results on two challenging cross-lingual entity linking datasets spanning over 11 languages show that the pivot-based approach outperforms both the lexicon-based and semantic-based approach by a large margin.",0

In this paper, we study the relationship between structure and toxicity in conversations on Twitter. We collect 1.18M conversations (58.5M tweets, 4.4M users) prompted by tweets that are posted by or mention major news outlets over one year and candidates who ran in the 2018 US midterm elections over four months. We analyze the conversations at the individual, dyad, and group level. At the individual level, we find that toxicity is spread across many low to moderately toxic users. At the dyad level, we observe that toxic replies are more likely to come from users who do not have any social connection nor share many common friends with the poster. At the group level, we find that toxic conversations tend to have larger, wider, and deeper reply trees, but sparser follow graphs. To test the predictive power of the conversational structure, we consider two prediction tasks. In the first prediction task, we demonstrate that the structural features can be used to predict whether the conversation will become toxic as early as the first ten replies. In the second prediction task, we show that the structural characteristics of the conversation are also predictive of whether the next reply posted by a specific user will be toxic or not. We observe that the structural and linguistic characteristics of the conversations are complementary in both prediction tasks. Our findings inform the design of healthier social media platforms and demonstrate that models based on the structural characteristics of conversations can be used to detect early signs of toxicity and potentially steer conversations in a less toxic direction.",2

Due to its popularity, WhatsApp has become a powerful and cheap tool for political campaigning being widely used during the 2019 Indian general election, where it was used to connect to the voters on a large scale. Along with the campaigning, there have been reports that WhatsApp has also become a breeding ground for harmful speech against various protected groups and religious minorities. Many such messages attempt to instil fear among the population about a specific (minority) community. According to research on inter-group conflict, such ‘fear speech’ messages could have a lasting impact and might lead to real offline violence. In this paper, we perform the first large scale study on fear speech across thousands of public WhatsApp groups discussing politics in India. We curate a new dataset and try to characterize fear speech from this dataset. We observe that users writing fear speech messages use various events and symbols to create the illusion of fear among the reader about a target community. We build models to classify fear speech and observe that current state-of-the-art NLP models do not perform well at this task. Fear speech messages tend to spread faster and could potentially go undetected by classifiers built to detect traditional toxic speech due to their low toxic nature. Finally, using a novel methodology to target users with Facebook ads, we conduct a survey among the users of these WhatsApp groups to understand the types of users who consume and share fear speech. We believe that this work opens up new research questions that are very different from tackling hate speech which the research community has been traditionally involved in.

An industrial cloud platform contains a huge number of disks, and disk failure is a common cause of service unreliability. In recent years, many machine learning based disk failure prediction approaches have been proposed, and they can predict disk failures based on disk status data before the failures actually happen. In this way, proactive actions can be taken in advance to improve service reliability. However, existing approaches treat each disk individually and do not explore the influence of the neighboring disks. In this paper, we propose Neighborhood-Temporal Attention Model (NTAM), a novel deep learning based approach to disk failure prediction. When predicting whether or not a disk will fail in near future, NTAM is a novel approach that not only utilizes a disk’s own status data, but also considers its neighbors’ status data. Moreover, NTAM includes a novel attention-based temporal component to capture the temporal nature of the disk status data. Besides, we propose a data enhancement method, called Temporal Progressive Sampling (TPS), to handle the extreme data imbalance issue. We evaluate NTAM on a public dataset as well as two industrial datasets collected from millions of disks in Microsoft Azure. Our experimental results show that NTAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competitors. Also, our empirical evaluations indicate the effectiveness of the neighborhood-ware component and the temporal component underlying NTAM as well as the effectiveness of TPS.

We find that HTTP Polling remains significantly more common than WebSockets, and WebSocket adoption appears to have stagnated in the past two to three years. We investigate some of the possible reasons for this decrease in the rate of adoption, and we contrast the adoption process to that of other web technologies. Our findings further suggest that even when WebSockets are employed, the prescribed best practices for securing them are often disregarded. The dataset is made available in the hopes that it may help inform the development of future real-time solutions for the web.",3

However, the inability of GNNs to model substructures in graphs remains a significant drawback. Specifically, message-passing GNNs (MPGNNs), as the prevailing type of GNNs, have been theoretically shown unable to distinguish, detect or count many graph substructures. While efforts have been paid to complement the inability, existing works either rely on pre-defined substructure sets, thus being less flexible, or are lacking in theoretical insights. In this paper, we propose GSKN1, a GNN model with a theoretically stronger ability to distinguish graph structures. Specifically, we design GSKN based on anonymous walks (AWs), flexible substructure units, and derive it upon feature mappings of graph kernels (GKs). We theoretically show that GSKN provably extends the 1-WL test, and hence the maximally powerful MPGNNs from both graph-level and node-level viewpoints. Correspondingly, various experiments are leveraged to evaluate GSKN, where GSKN outperforms a wide range of baselines, endorsing the analysis.",4

The well-designed propagation mechanism which has been demonstrated effective is the most fundamental part of GNNs. Although most of GNNs basically follow a message passing manner, litter effort has been made to discover and analyze their essential relations. In this paper, we establish a surprising connection between different propagation mechanisms with a unified optimization problem, showing that despite the proliferation of various GNNs, in fact, their proposed propagation mechanisms are the optimal solution optimizing a feature fitting function over a wide class of graph kernels with a graph regularization term. Our proposed unified optimization framework, summarizing the commonalities between several of the most representative GNNs, not only provides a macroscopic view on surveying the relations between different GNNs, but also further opens up new opportunities for flexibly designing new GNNs. With the proposed framework, we discover that existing works usually utilize naïve graph convolutional kernels for feature fitting function, and we further develop two novel objective functions considering adjustable graph kernels showing low-pass or high-pass filtering capabilities respectively. Moreover, we provide the convergence proofs and expressive power comparisons for the proposed models. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets clearly show that the proposed GNNs not only outperform the state-of-the-art methods but also have good ability to alleviate over-smoothing, and further verify the feasibility for designing GNNs with our unified optimization framework.",28

In recent years, state-of-the-art classification methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown their superiority over traditional ones such as label propagation. However, the sophisticated architectures of these neural models will lead to a complex prediction mechanism, which could not make full use of valuable prior knowledge lying in the data, e.g., structurally correlated nodes tend to have the same class. In this paper, we propose a framework based on knowledge distillation to address the above issues. Our framework extracts the knowledge of an arbitrary learned GNN model (teacher model), and injects it into a well-designed student model. The student model is built with two simple prediction mechanisms, i.e., label propagation and feature transformation, which naturally preserves structure-based and feature-based prior knowledge, respectively. In specific, we design the student model as a trainable combination of parameterized label propagation and feature transformation modules. As a result, the learned student can benefit from both prior knowledge and the knowledge in GNN teachers for more effective predictions. Moreover, the learned student model has a more interpretable prediction process than GNNs. We conduct experiments on five public benchmark datasets and employ seven GNN models including GCN, GAT, APPNP, SAGE, SGC, GCNII and GLP as the teacher models. Experimental results show that the learned student model can consistently outperform its corresponding teacher model by on average. Code and data are available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/CPF",9

Existing work usually feeds graphs to GNNs in random order for training. However, graphs can vary greatly in their difficulty for classification, and we argue that GNNs can benefit from an easy-to-difficult curriculum, similar to the learning process of humans. Evaluating the difficulty of graphs is challenging due to the high irregularity of graph data. To address this issue, we present the CurGraph (Curriculum Learning for Graph Classification) framework, that analyzes the graph difficulty in the high-level semantic feature space. Specifically, we use the infomax method to obtain graph-level embeddings and a neural density estimator to model the embedding distributions. Then we calculate the difficulty scores of graphs based on the intra-class and inter-class distributions of their embeddings. Given the difficulty scores, CurGraph first exposes a GNN to easy graphs, before gradually moving on to hard ones. To provide a soft transition from easy to hard, we propose a smooth-step method, which utilizes a time-variant smooth function to filter out hard graphs. Thanks to CurGraph, a GNN learns from the graphs at the border of its capability, neither too easy or too hard, to gradually expand its border at each training step. Empirically, CurGraph yields significant gains for popular GNN models on graph classification and enables them to achieve superior performance on miscellaneous graphs.",4

Most GCNs learn the node representations in Euclidean geometry, but that could have a high distortion in the case of embedding graphs with scale-free or hierarchical structure. Recently, some GCNs are proposed to deal with this problem in non-Euclidean geometry, e.g., hyperbolic geometry. Although hyperbolic GCNs achieve promising performance, existing hyperbolic graph operations actually cannot rigorously follow the hyperbolic geometry, which may limit the ability of hyperbolic geometry and thus hurt the performance of hyperbolic GCNs. In this paper, we propose a novel hyperbolic GCN named Lorentzian graph convolutional network (LGCN), which rigorously guarantees the learned node features follow the hyperbolic geometry. Specifically, we rebuild the graph operations of hyperbolic GCNs with Lorentzian version, e.g., the feature transformation and non-linear activation. Also, an elegant neighborhood aggregation method is designed based on the centroid of Lorentzian distance. Moreover, we prove some proposed graph operations are equivalent in different types of hyperbolic geometry, which fundamentally indicates their correctness. Experiments on six datasets show that LGCN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. LGCN has lower distortion to learn the representation of tree-likeness graphs compared with existing hyperbolic GCNs. We also find that the performance of some hyperbolic GCNs can be improved by simply replacing the graph operations with those we defined in this paper.",6

However, self-attention suffers from quadratic computational and memory complexities, prohibiting its applications on long sequences. Existing approaches that address this issue mainly rely on a sparse attention context, either using a local window, or a permuted bucket obtained by locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) or sorting, while crucial information may be lost. Inspired by the idea of vector quantization that uses cluster centroids to approximate items, we propose LISA (LInear-time Self Attention), which enjoys both the effectiveness of vanilla self-attention and the efficiency of sparse attention. LISA scales linearly with the sequence length, while enabling full contextual attention via computing differentiable histograms of codeword distributions. Meanwhile, unlike some efficient attention methods, our method poses no restriction on casual masking or sequence length. We evaluate our method on four real-world datasets for sequential recommendation. The results show that LISA outperforms the state-of-the-art efficient attention methods in both performance and speed; and it is up to 57x faster and 78x more memory efficient than vanilla self-attention.",1

Recently, there have been many efforts to utilize time information of users’ interactions with items to capture inherent temporal patterns of user behaviors and offer timely recommendations at a given time. Existing studies regard the time information as a single type of feature and focus on how to associate it with user preferences on items. However, we argue they are insufficient for fully learning the time information because the temporal patterns of user preference are usually heterogeneous. A user’s preference for a particular item may 1) increase periodically or 2) evolve over time under the influence of significant recent events, and each of these two kinds of temporal pattern appears with some unique characteristics. In this paper, we first define the unique characteristics of the two kinds of temporal pattern of user preference that should be considered in time-aware recommender systems. Then we propose a novel recommender system for timely recommendations, called TimelyRec, which jointly learns the heterogeneous temporal patterns of user preference considering all of the defined characteristics. In TimelyRec, a cascade of two encoders captures the temporal patterns of user preference using a proposed attention module for each encoder. Moreover, we introduce an evaluation scenario that evaluates the performance on predicting an interesting item and when to recommend the item simultaneously in top-K recommendation (i.e., item-timing recommendation). Our extensive experiments on a scenario for item recommendation and the proposed scenario for item-timing recommendation on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TimelyRec and the proposed attention modules.",2

However, prior arts mainly follow the traditional recommendation strategies like collaborative filtering, which usually treat individual drugs as mutually independent, while the latent interactions among drugs, e.g., synergistic or antagonistic effect, have been largely ignored. To that end, in this paper, we target at developing a new paradigm for drug package recommendation with considering the interaction effect within drugs, in which the interaction effects could be affected by patient conditions. Specifically, we first design a pre-training method based on neural collaborative filtering to get the initial embedding of patients and drugs. Then, the drug interaction graph will be initialized based on medical records and domain knowledge. Along this line, we propose a new Drug Package Recommendation (DPR) framework with two variants, respectively DPR on Weighted Graph (DPR-WG) and DPR on Attributed Graph (DPR-AG) to solve the problem, in which each the interactions will be described as signed weights or attribute vectors. In detail, a mask layer is utilized to capture the impact of patient condition, and graph neural networks (GNNs) are leveraged for the final graph induction task to embed the package. Extensive experiments on a real-world data set from a first-rate hospital demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPR framework compared with several competitive baseline methods, and further support the heuristic study for the drug package generation task with adequate performance.",4

This is attributed to their capability on learning good user and item embeddings by exploiting the collaborative signals from the high-order neighbors. Like other GCN models, the GCN based recommendation models also suffer from the notorious over-smoothing problem – when stacking more layers, node embeddings become more similar and eventually indistinguishable, resulted in performance degradation. The recently proposed LightGCN and LR-GCN alleviate this problem to some extent, however, we argue that they overlook an important factor for the over-smoothing problem in recommendation, that is, high-order neighboring users with no common interests of a user can be also involved in the user’s embedding learning in the graph convolution operation. As a result, the multi-layer graph convolution will make users with dissimilar interests have similar embeddings. In this paper, we propose a novel Interest-aware Message-Passing GCN (IMP-GCN) recommendation model, which performs high-order graph convolution inside subgraphs. The subgraph consists of users with similar interests and their interacted items. To form the subgraphs, we design an unsupervised subgraph generation module, which can effectively identify users with common interests by exploiting both user feature and graph structure. To this end, our model can avoid propagating negative information from high-order neighbors into embedding learning. Experimental results on three large-scale benchmark datasets show that our model can gain performance improvement by stacking more layers and outperform the state-of-the-art GCN-based recommendation models significantly.",12

For general weighted data, the commonly used sampling algorithm for computing the (weighted) Jaccard similarity is the Consistent Weighted Sampling (CWS). A convenient (and perhaps also mysterious) implementation of CWS is the so-called “0-bit CWS” published in KDD 2015 [31], which, in this paper, we refer to as the “relaxed CWS” and was purely an empirical observation without theoretical justification. The difficulty in the analysis of the “relaxed CWS” is due to the complicated probability problem, which we could not resolve at this point.",0

Further, how to explain outliers, i.e., outlier interpretation, is more significant, which can provide valuable insights for analysts to better understand, solve, and prevent these detected outliers. However, only limited studies consider this problem. Most of the existing methods are based on the score-and-search manner. They select a feature subspace as interpretation per queried outlier by estimating outlying scores of the outlier in searched subspaces. Due to the tremendous searching space, they have to utilize pruning strategies and set a maximum subspace length, often resulting in suboptimal interpretation results. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel Attention-guided Triplet deviation network for Outlier interpretatioN (ATON). Instead of searching a subspace, ATON directly learns an embedding space and learns how to attach attention to each embedding dimension (i.e., capturing the contribution of each dimension to the outlierness of the queried outlier). Specifically, ATON consists of a feature embedding module and a customized self-attention learning module, which are optimized by a triplet deviation-based loss function. We obtain an optimal attention-guided embedding space with expanded high-level information and rich semantics, and thus outlying behaviors of the queried outlier can be better unfolded. ATON finally distills a subspace of original features from the embedding module and the attention coefficient. With the good generality, ATON can be employed as an additional step of any black-box outlier detector. A comprehensive suite of experiments is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of ATON. The proposed ATON significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on 12 real-world datasets and obtains good scalability w.r.t. both data dimensionality and data size.",5

In this work, we consider the setting where data items in the stream belong to one of several disjoint groups and investigate the optimization problem with an additional fairness constraint that limits selection to a given number of items from each group. We then propose efficient algorithms for the fairness-aware variant of the streaming submodular maximization problem. In particular, we first give a -approximation algorithm that requires passes over the stream for any constant ε > 0. Moreover, we give a single-pass streaming algorithm that has the same approximation ratio of when unlimited buffer sizes and post-processing time are permitted, and discuss how to adapt it to more practical settings where the buffer sizes are bounded. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms on two real-world applications, namely maximum coverage on large graphs and personalized recommendation.",2

The most apparent challenge compared with the offline learning manner is the issue of consecutive emergence of new categories, when tackling non-static categorical distribution. Non-stationary stream settings often appear in real-world applications, e.g., online classification in E-commerce systems that involves the incoming productions, or the summary of news topics on social networks (Twitter). Ideally, a learning model should be able to learn novel concepts from labeled data (in new tasks) and reduce the abrupt degradation of model performance on the old concept (also named catastrophic forgetting problem). In this work, we focus on improving the performance of the stream mining approach under the constrained resources, where both the memory resource of old data and labeled new instances are limited/scarce. We propose a simple yet efficient resource-constrained framework CLEAR to facilitate previous challenges during the one-pass stream mining. Specifically, CLEAR focuses on creating and calibrating the class representation (the prototype) in the embedding space. We first apply the contrastive-prototype learning on large amount of unlabeled data, and generate the discriminative prototype for each class in the embedding space. Next, for updating on new tasks/categories, we propose a drift estimation strategy to calibrate/compensate for the drift of each class representation, which could reduce the knowledge forgetting without storing any previous data. We perform experiments on public datasets (e.g., CUB200, CIFAR100) under stream setting, our approach is consistently and clearly better than many state-of-the-art methods, along with both the memory and annotation restriction.",1

Querying KGs remains a foundational and challenging problem due to their size and complexity. Promising approaches to tackle this problem include embedding the KG units (e.g., entities and relations) in a Euclidean space such that the query embedding contains the information relevant to its results. These approaches, however, fail to capture the hierarchical nature and semantic information of the entities present in the graph. Additionally, most of these approaches only utilize multi-hop queries (that can be modeled by simple translation operations) to learn embeddings and ignore more complex operations such as intersection, and union of simpler queries. To tackle such complex operations, in this paper, we formulate KG representation learning as a self-supervised logical query reasoning problem that utilizes translation, intersection and union queries over KGs. We propose Hyperboloid Embeddings (HypE), a novel self-supervised dynamic reasoning framework, that utilizes positive first-order existential queries on a KG to learn representations of its entities and relations as hyperboloids in a Poincaré ball. HypE models the positive first-order queries as geometrical translation, intersection, and union. For the problem of KG reasoning in real-world datasets, the proposed HypE model significantly outperforms the state-of-the art results. We also apply HypE to an anomaly detection task on a popular e-commerce website product taxonomy as well as hierarchically organized web articles and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to existing baseline methods. Finally, we also visualize the learned HypE embeddings in a Poincaré ball to clearly interpret and comprehend the representation space.",15

The reason is rooted deep within its architecture that relies on data providers to keep the data available, queryable, and up-to-date at all times – an expectation that many data providers in reality cannot live up to for an extended (or infinite) period of time. Hence, decentralized architectures have recently been proposed that use replication to keep the data available in case the data provider fails. Although this increases availability, it does not help keeping the data up-to-date or allow users to query and access previous versions of a dataset. In this paper, we therefore propose ColChain (COLlaborative knowledge CHAINs), a novel decentralized architecture based on blockchains that not only lowers the burden for the data providers but at the same time also allows users to propose updates to faulty or outdated data, trace updates back to their origin, and query older versions of the data.

Existing methods have focused on improving the EHR feature representations using attention mechanisms, time-aware models, or external knowledge. However, they ignore the importance of using personalized information to make predictions. Besides, the reliability of their prediction interpretations needs to be improved since their interpretable attention scores are not explicitly reasoned from disease progression paths. In this paper, we propose MedPath to solve these challenges and augment existing risk prediction models with the ability to use personalized information and provide reliable interpretations inferring from disease progression paths. Firstly, MedPath extracts personalized knowledge graphs (PKGs) containing all possible disease progression paths from observed symptoms to target diseases from a large-scale online medical knowledge graph. Next, to augment existing EHR encoders for achieving better predictions, MedPath learns a PKG embedding by conducting multi-hop message passing from symptom nodes to target disease nodes through a graph neural network encoder. Since MedPath reasons disease progression by paths existing in PKGs, it can provide explicit explanations for the prediction by pointing out how observed symptoms can finally lead to target diseases. Experimental results on three real-world medical datasets show that MedPath is effective in improving the performance of eight state-of-the-art methods with higher F1 scores and AUCs. Our case study also demonstrates that MedPath can greatly improve the explicitness of the risk prediction interpretation.1",2

Therefore, app removal is a common practice, and market maintainers have to remove undesired apps from the market periodically in a reactive manner. Although a number of reports and news media have mentioned removed apps, our research community still lacks the comprehensive understanding of the landscape of this kind of apps. To fill the void, in this paper, we present a large-scale and longitudinal study of removed apps in iOS app store. We first make great efforts to record daily snapshot of iOS app store continuously in a span of 1.5 years. By comparing each two consecutive snapshots, we have collected the information of over 1 million removed apps with their accurate removed date. This comprehensive dataset enables us to characterize the overall landscape of removed apps. We observe that, although most of the removed apps are low-quality apps (e.g., outdated and abandoned), a number of the removed apps are quite popular. We further investigate the practical reasons leading to the removal of such popular apps, and observe several interesting reasons, including ranking fraud, fake description, and content issues, etc. More importantly, most of these mis-behaviors can be reflected on app meta information including app description, app review, and ASO keywords. It motivates us to design an automated approach to flagging the removed apps.

Existing solutions usually adopt either an origin-centric design or a code-centric design, and suffer from one or several of the following limitations: coarse protection granularity, poor flexibility in terms of access control policy establishment, and incompatibility with existing apps/OSes due to the need of modifying the apps and/or the underlying OS. More importantly, none of the existing works can organically deal with all the five web-app interaction mechanisms. In this paper, we propose ReACt, a novel Resource-centric Access Control design that can coherently work with all the web-app interaction mechanisms while addressing the above-mentioned limitations. We have implemented a prototype system on Android, and performed extensive evaluation on it. The evaluation results show that our system works well with existing commercial off-the-shelf Android apps and different versions of Android OS, and it can achieve the design goals with small overhead.",0

EMG sensors can sense electrical potential from muscles due to finger activation, thus offering rich information for fine-grained finger motion sensing. However converting the sensor information to 3D finger poses is non trivial since signals from multiple fingers superimpose at the sensor in complex patterns. Towards solving this problem, NeuroPose fuses information from anatomical constraints of finger motion with machine learning architectures on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Encoder-Decoder Networks, and ResNets to extract 3D finger motion from noisy EMG data. The generated motion pattern is temporally smooth as well as anatomically consistent. Furthermore, a transfer learning algorithm is leveraged to adapt a pretrained model on one user to a new user with minimal training overhead. A systematic study with 12 users demonstrates a median error of 6.24° and a 90%-ile error of 18.33° in tracking 3D finger joint angles. The accuracy is robust to natural variation in sensor mounting positions as well as changes in wrist positions of the user. NeuroPose is implemented on a smartphone with a processing latency of 0.101s, and a low energy overhead.",3

With visibility to drill down to individual users, we find use highly unbalanced and the network supported by only a handful of relatively heavy consumers. 45% of users are offline more days than online, and the median user consumes only 77 MB per day online and 36 MB per day on average, limiting consumption by frequently “topping up” in small amounts. Outside video and social media, messaging and IP calling provided by over-the-top services like Facebook Messenger, QQ, and WhatsApp comprise a relatively large percentage of traffic consistently across both heavy and light users.

Existing NPPs feed all history events into neural networks, assuming that all event types contribute to the prediction of the target type. However, this assumption can be problematic because in reality some event types do not contribute to the predictions of another type. To correct this defect, we learn to omit those types of events that do not contribute to the prediction of one target type during the formulation of NPPs. Towards this end, we simultaneously consider the tasks of (1) finding event types that contribute to predictions of the target types and (2) learning a NPP model from event sequences. For the former, we formulate a latent graph, with event types being vertices and non-zero contributing relationships being directed edges; then we propose a probabilistic graph generator, from which we sample a latent graph. For the latter, the sampled graph can be readily used as a plug-in to modify an existing NPP model. Because these two tasks are nested, we propose to optimize the model parameters through bilevel programming, and develop an efficient solution based on truncated gradient back-propagation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show the improved performance against state-of-the-art baselines. This work removes disturbance of non-contributing event types with the aid of a validation procedure, similar to the practice to mitigate overfitting used when training machine learning models.",4

The NODE-based discriminator performs a hidden vector evolution trajectory-based classification rather than classifying with a hidden vector at the last layer only. Our generator also adopts an ODE layer at the very beginning of its architecture to transform its initial input vector (i.e., the concatenation of a noisy vector and a condition vector in our case) onto another latent vector space suitable for the generation process.

Modeling student activities in continuous time and predicting their next study time are important problems that can help in creating personalized timely interventions to mitigate these challenges. However, previous attempts on dynamic modeling of student procrastination suffer from major issues: they are unable to predict the next activity times, cannot deal with missing activity history, are not personalized, and disregard important course properties, such as assignment deadlines, that are essential in explaining the cramming behavior. To resolve these problems, we introduce a new personalized stimuli-sensitive Hawkes process model (SSHP), by jointly modeling all student-assignment pairs and utilizing their similarities, to predict students’ next activity times even when there are no historical observations. Unlike regular point processes that assume a constant external triggering effect from the environment, we model three dynamic types of external stimuli, according to assignment availabilities, assignment deadlines, and each student’s time management habits. Our experiments on two synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets show a superior performance of future activity prediction, comparing with state-of-the-art models.

Existing methods for query-POI matching, such as Google Maps and Uber, have a natural focus on measuring the static semantic similarity between contextual information of queries and geographical information of POIs. However, it remains challenging for dynamic and personalized online query-POI matching because of the non-stationary and situational context-dependent query-POI relevance. Moreover, the large volume of online queries requires an adaptive and incremental model training strategy that is efficient and scalable in the online scenario. To this end, in this paper, we propose an Incremental Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning (IncreSTGL) framework for intelligent online query-POI matching.

Then, we propose an incremental graph representation learning module to refine and update query-POI interaction graphs in an online incremental fashion, which includes: (i) a contextual graph attention operation quantifying query-POI correlation based on historical queries under dynamic situational context, (ii) a graph discrimination operation capturing the sequential query-POI relevance drift from a holistic view of personalized preference and social homophily, and (iii) a multi-level temporal attention operation summarizing the temporal variations of query-POI interaction graphs for subsequent query-POI matching. Finally, we introduce a lightweight semantic matching module for online query-POI similarity measurement.

However, existing models only update the interaction information of nodes along the timeline. It causes the problem of information asymmetry, where early updated nodes often have much less information than the most recently updated nodes. The information asymmetry is essentially a blockage of information flow. We propose HILI (Highly Liquid Temporal Interaction Graph Embeddings) to predict highly liquid embeddings on temporal interaction graphs. Our embedding model makes interaction information highly liquid without information asymmetry. A specific least recently used-based and frequency-based windows are used to determine the priority of the nodes that receive the latest interaction information. HILI updates node embeddings by attention layers. The attention layers learn the correlation between nodes and update node embedding simply and quickly. In addition, HILI elaborately designs, a self-linear layer, a linear layer initialized in a novel method. A self-linear layer reduces the expected space of predicted embedding of the next interacting node and makes predicted embedding focus more on relevant nodes.

Current efforts on joint entity and relation extraction focus on enhancing the interaction between entity recognition and relation extraction through parameter sharing, joint decoding, or other ad-hoc tricks (e.g., modeled as a semi-Markov decision process, cast as a multi-round reading comprehension task). However, there are still two issues on the table. First, the interaction utilized by most methods is still weak and uni-directional, which is unable to model the mutual dependency between the two tasks. Second, relation triggers are ignored by most methods, which can help explain why humans would extract a relation in the sentence. They’re essential for relation extraction but overlooked.

Currently, most KG embedding models are trained based on negative sampling, i.e., the model aims to maximize some similarity of the connected entities in the KG, while minimizing the similarity of the sampled disconnected entities. Negative sampling helps to reduce the time complexity of model learning by only considering a subset of negative instances, which may fail to deliver stable model performance due to the uncertainty in the sampling procedure. To avoid such deficiency, we propose a new framework for KG embedding—Efficient Non-Sampling Knowledge Graph Embedding (NS-KGE). The basic idea is to consider all of the negative instances in the KG for model learning, and thus to avoid negative sampling. The framework can be applied to square-loss based knowledge graph embedding models or models whose loss can be converted to a square loss. A natural side-effect of this non-sampling strategy is the increased computational complexity of model learning. To solve the problem, we leverage mathematical derivations to reduce the complexity of non-sampling loss function, which eventually provides us both better efficiency and better accuracy in KG embedding compared with existing models.

Prevalent graph embedding approaches, e.g., TransE, learn structured knowledge via representing graph elements (i.e., entities/relations) into dense embeddings and capturing their triple-level relationship with spatial distance. However, they are hardly generalizable to the elements never visited in training and are intrinsically vulnerable to graph incompleteness. In contrast, textual encoding approaches, e.g., KG-BERT, resort to graph triple’s text and triple-level contextualized representations. They are generalizable enough and robust to the incompleteness, especially when coupled with pre-trained encoders. But two major drawbacks limit the performance: (1) high overheads due to the costly scoring of all possible triples in inference, and (2) a lack of structured knowledge in the textual encoder. In this paper, we follow the textual encoding paradigm and aim to alleviate its drawbacks by augmenting it with graph embedding techniques – a complementary hybrid of both paradigms. Specifically, we partition each triple into two asymmetric parts as in translation-based graph embedding approach, and encode both parts into contextualized representations by a Siamese-style textual encoder. Built upon the representations, our model employs both deterministic classifier and spatial measurement for representation and structure learning respectively. It thus reduces the overheads by reusing graph elements’ embeddings to avoid combinatorial explosion, and enhances structured knowledge by exploring the spatial characteristics. Moreover, we develop a self-adaptive ensemble scheme to further improve the performance by incorporating triple scores from an existing graph embedding model.

The success of existing methods heavily relies on the quality of knowledge graphs. The entities with few triplets tend to be learned with less expressive power. Fortunately, there are many knowledge graphs constructed from various sources, the representations of which could contain much information. We propose an adversarial embedding transfer network ATransN, which transfers knowledge from one or more teacher knowledge graphs to a target one through an aligned entity set without explicit data leakage. Specifically, we add soft constraints on aligned entity pairs and neighbours to the existing knowledge representation learning methods. To handle the problem of possible distribution differences between teacher and target knowledge graphs, we introduce an adversarial adaption module. The discriminator of this module evaluates the degree of consistency between the embeddings of an aligned entity pair. The consistency score is then used as the weights of soft constraints. It is not necessary to acquire the relations and triplets in teacher knowledge graphs because we only utilize the entity representations. Knowledge graph completion results show that ATransN achieves better performance against baselines without transfer on three datasets, CN3l, WK3l, and DWY100k. The ablation study demonstrates that ATransN can bring steady and consistent improvement in different settings. The extension of combining other knowledge graph embedding algorithms and the extension with three teacher graphs display the promising generalization of the adversarial transfer network.",0

In a KG, a node denotes an entity, and an edge (or link) denotes a relationship between the entities represented by the nodes. Knowledge graph completion infers and predicts missing edges in a KG automatically. Knowledge graph embeddings have shed light on addressing this task. Recent research embeds KGs in hyperbolic (negatively curved) space instead of conventional Euclidean (zero curved) space and is effective in capturing hierarchical structures. However, as multi-relational graphs, KGs are not structured uniformly and display intrinsic heterogeneous structures. They usually contain rich types of structures, such as hierarchical and cyclic typed structures. Embedding KGs in single-curvature space, such as Euclidean or hyperbolic space, overlooks the intrinsic heterogeneous structures of KGs, and therefore cannot accurately capture their structures. To address this issue, we propose Mixed-Curvature Multi-Relational Graph Neural Network (M2GNN), a generic approach that embeds multi-relational KGs in a mixed-curvature space for knowledge graph completion. Specifically, we define and construct a mixed-curvature space through a product manifold combining multiple single-curvature spaces (e.g., spherical, hyperbolic, or Euclidean) with the purpose of modeling a variety of structures. However, constructing a mixed-curvature space typically requires manually defining the fixed curvatures, which needs domain knowledge and additional data analysis. Improperly defined curvature space also cannot capture the structures of KGs accurately. To address this problem, we set mixed-curvatures as trainable parameters to better capture the underlying structures of the KGs. Furthermore, we propose a Graph Neural Updater by leveraging the heterogeneous relational context in mixed-curvature space to improve the quality of the embedding. Experiments on three KG datasets demonstrate that the proposed M2GNN can outperform its single geometry counterpart as well as state-of-the-art embedding methods on the KG completion task.",7

A number of real-world applications such as collaborative filtering and text mining can be formulated as a low-rank matrix completion problems, which recovers incomplete matrix using low-rank assumptions. To ensure that the matrix solution has a low rank, a recent trend is to use nonconvex regularizers that adaptively penalize singular values. They offer good recovery performance and have nice theoretical properties, but are computationally expensive due to repeated access to individual singular values. In this paper, based on the key insight that adaptive shrinkage on singular values improve empirical performance, we propose a new nonconvex low-rank regularizer called ”nuclear norm minus Frobenius norm” regularizer, which is scalable, adaptive and sound. We first show it provably holds the adaptive shrinkage property. Further, we discover its factored form which bypasses the computation of singular values and allows fast optimization by general optimization algorithms. Stable recovery and convergence are guaranteed. Extensive low-rank matrix completion experiments on a number of synthetic and real-world data sets show that the proposed method obtains state-of-the-art recovery performance while being the fastest in comparison to existing low-rank matrix learning methods. 1",0

Click models, which study how users interact with a ranked list of items, provide a useful understanding of user feedback for learning ranking models. Constructing ”right” dependencies is the key of any successful click model. However, probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) have to rely on manually assigned dependencies, and oversimplify user behaviors. Existing neural network based methods promote PGMs by enhancing the expressive ability and allowing flexible dependencies, but still suffer from exposure bias and inferior estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Adversarial Imitation Click Model (AICM), based on imitation learning. Firstly, we explicitly learn the reward function that recovers users’ intrinsic utility and underlying intentions. Secondly, we model user interactions with a ranked list as a dynamic system instead of one-step click prediction, alleviating the exposure bias problem. Finally, we minimize the JS divergence through adversarial training and learn a stable distribution of click sequences, which makes AICM generalize well across different distributions of ranked lists. A theoretical analysis has indicated that AICM reduces the exposure bias from O(T2) to O(T). Our studies on a public web search dataset show that AICM not only outperforms state-of-the-art models in traditional click metrics but also achieves superior performance in addressing the exposure bias and recovering the underlying patterns of click sequences.",2

However, a critical prerequisite for these benefits is having fine-grained knowledge of the city. Thus, unlike previous works that are limited to coarse-grained data, we extend the horizon of urban flow prediction to fine granularity which raises specific challenges: 1) the predominance of inter-grid transitions observed in fine-grained data makes it more complicated to capture the spatial dependencies among grid cells at a global scale; 2) it is very challenging to learn the impact of external factors (e.g., weather) on a large number of grid cells separately. To address these two challenges, we present a Spatio-Temporal Relation Network (STRN) to predict fine-grained urban flows. First, a backbone network is used to learn high-level representations for each cell. Second, we present a Global Relation Module (GloNet) that captures global spatial dependencies much more efficiently compared to existing methods. Third, we design a Meta Learner that takes external factors and land functions (e.g., POI density) as inputs to produce meta knowledge and boost model performances.

In this paper, we propose a framework, named Multi-Agent Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning (Master), for intelligently recommending public accessible charging stations by jointly considering various long-term spatiotemporal factors. Specifically, by regarding each charging station as an individual agent, we formulate this problem as a multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning task.

Moreover, to quantify the influence of future potential charging competition, we introduce a delayed access strategy to exploit the knowledge of future charging competition during training. After that, to effectively optimize multiple learning objectives, we extend the centralized attentive critic to multi-critics and develop a dynamic gradient re-weighting strategy to adaptively guide the optimization direction. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Master achieves the best comprehensive performance compared with nine baseline approaches.",6

However, they have never involved any spatiotemporal evolution of uncertainties under various contexts, and also have kept suffering from the poor efficiency of statistical uncertainty estimation while training models with multiple times. To provide high-quality uncertainty quantification for spatiotemporal forecasting, we propose an uncertainty learning mechanism to simultaneously estimate internal data quality and quantify external uncertainty regarding various contextual interactions. To address the issue of lacking labels of uncertainty, we propose a hierarchical data turbulence scheme where we can actively inject controllable uncertainty for guidance, and hence provide insights to both uncertainty quantification and weak supervised learning. Finally, we re-calibrate and boost the prediction performance by devising a gated-based bridge to adaptively leverage the learned uncertainty into predictions. Extensive experiments on three real-world spatiotemporal mobility sets have corroborated the superiority of our proposed model in terms of both forecasting and uncertainty quantification.",1

Such an intent recommendation service has been widely used in e-commerce applications, such as Taobao and Amazon. The most difficult part is to accurately predict user’s search intent, so as to improve user’s search experience and reduce tedious typing especially on mobile phones. Existing methods mainly rely on user’s historical search behaviors to estimate user’s current intent, but they do not make full use of the feedback information between the user and the intent recommendation system. Essentially, feedback information is the key factor for capturing dynamics of user search intents in real time. Therefore, we propose a feedback interactive neural network (FINN) to estimate user’s potential search intent more accurately, by making full use of the feedback interaction with the following three parts: 1) Both positive feedback (PF) and negative feedback (NF) information are collected simultaneously. PF includes user’s search intent information that the user is interested in, such as the query used and the title clicked. NF indicates user’s search intent information that the user is not interested in, such as the query recommended by the system but not clicked by the user. 2) A filter-attention (FAT) structure is proposed to filter out the noisy feedback and get more accurate positive and negative intentions of users. 3) A multi-task learning is designed to match the correlation between the user’s search intent and query candidates, which can learn and recommend query candidates from user interests and disinterests associated with each user. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted by comparing with state-of-the-art methods, and it shows that our FINN method can achieve the best performance using the Taobao mobile application dataset. In addition, online experimental results also show that our method improves the CTR by 8% and attracts more than 7.98% of users than the baseline.",1

Prior to the most recent US midterm elections in 2018, the mobile app Outvote randomized an aspect of their system, hoping to unobtrusively assess the causal effect of their users’ messages on voter turnout. However, properly assessing this causal effect is hindered by multiple statistical challenges, including attenuation bias due to mismeasurement of subjects’ outcomes and low precision due to two-sided non-compliance with subjects’ assignments. We address these challenges, which are likely to impinge upon any study that seeks to randomize authentic friend-to-friend interactions, by tailoring the statistical analysis to make use of additional data about both users and subjects. Using meta-data of users’ in-app behavior, we reconstruct subjects’ positions in users’ queues. We use this information to refine the study population to more compliant subjects who were higher in the queues, and we do so in a systematic way which optimizes a proxy for the study’s power. To mitigate attenuation bias, we then use ancillary data of subjects’ matches to the voter rolls that lets us refine the study population to one with low rates of outcome mismeasurement. Our analysis reveals statistically significant treatment effects from friend-to-friend mobilization efforts ( 8.3, CI = (1.2, 15.3)) that are among the largest reported in the get-out-the-vote (GOTV) literature.

Task-relevant structures can be localized or sparse which are only involved in subgraphs or characterized by the interactions of subgraphs (a hierarchical perspective). A graph neural network should be able to efficiently extract task-relevant structures and be invariant to irrelevant parts, which is challenging for general message passing GNNs. In this work, we propose to learn graph representations from a sequence of subgraphs of the original graph to better capture task-relevant substructures or hierarchical structures and skip noisy parts. To this end, we design soft-mask GNN layer to extract desired subgraphs through the mask mechanism. The soft-mask is defined in a continuous space to maintain the differentiability and characterize the weights of different parts. Compared with existing subgraph or hierarchical representation learning methods and graph pooling operations, the soft-mask GNN layer is not limited by the fixed sample or drop ratio, and therefore is more flexible to extract subgraphs with arbitrary sizes. Extensive experiments on public graph benchmarks show that soft-mask mechanism brings performance improvements. And it also provides interpretability where visualizing the values of masks in each layer allows us to have an insight into the structures learned by the model.",0

Most graph CL methods first perform stochastic augmentation on the input graph to obtain two graph views and maximize the agreement of representations in the two views. Despite the prosperous development of graph CL methods, the design of graph augmentation schemes—a crucial component in CL—remains rarely explored. We argue that the data augmentation schemes should preserve intrinsic structures and attributes of graphs, which will force the model to learn representations that are insensitive to perturbation on unimportant nodes and edges. However, most existing methods adopt uniform data augmentation schemes, like uniformly dropping edges and uniformly shuffling features, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel graph contrastive representation learning method with adaptive augmentation that incorporates various priors for topological and semantic aspects of the graph. Specifically, on the topology level, we design augmentation schemes based on node centrality measures to highlight important connective structures. On the node attribute level, we corrupt node features by adding more noise to unimportant node features, to enforce the model to recognize underlying semantic information. We perform extensive experiments of node classification on a variety of real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines and even surpasses some supervised counterparts, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed contrastive framework with adaptive augmentation.",92

Yu, ","Graph representation learning has attracted increasing research attention. However, most existing studies fuse all structural features and node attributes to provide an overarching view of graphs, neglecting finer substructures’ semantics, and suffering from interpretation enigmas. This paper presents a novel hierarchical subgraph-level selection and embedding-based graph neural network for graph classification, namely SUGAR, to learn more discriminative subgraph representations and respond in an explanatory way. SUGAR reconstructs a sketched graph by extracting striking subgraphs as the representative part of the original graph to reveal subgraph-level patterns. To adaptively select striking subgraphs without prior knowledge, we develop a reinforcement pooling mechanism, which improves the generalization ability of the model. To differentiate subgraph representations among graphs, we present a self-supervised mutual information mechanism to encourage subgraph embedding to be mindful of the global graph structural properties by maximizing their mutual information. Extensive experiments on six typical bioinformatics datasets demonstrate a significant and consistent improvement in model quality with competitive performance and interpretability.",24

Gleich, ","Hypergraph-based machine learning methods are now widely recognized as important for modeling and using higher-order and multiway relationships between data objects. Local hypergraph clustering and semi-supervised learning specifically involve finding a well-connected set of nodes near a given set of labeled vertices. Although many methods for local graph clustering exist, there are relatively few for localized clustering in hypergraphs. Moreover, those that exist often lack flexibility to model a general class of hypergraph cut functions or cannot scale to large problems. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a new diffusion-based hypergraph clustering algorithm that solves a quadratic hypergraph cut based objective akin to a hypergraph analog of Andersen-Chung-Lang personalized PageRank clustering for graphs. We prove that, for graphs with fixed maximum hyperedge size, this method is strongly local, meaning that its runtime only depends on the size of the output instead of the size of the hypergraph and is highly scalable. Moreover, our method enables us to compute with a wide variety of cardinality-based hypergraph cut functions. We also prove that the clusters found by solving the new objective function satisfy a Cheeger-like quality guarantee. We demonstrate that on large real-world hypergraphs our new method finds better clusters and runs much faster than existing approaches. Specifically, it runs in a few seconds for hypergraphs with a few million hyperedges compared with minutes for a flow-based technique. We furthermore show that our framework is general enough that can also be used to solve other p-norm based cut objectives on hypergraphs.",7

Although initial research has focused on static graphs in applications such as molecular design and social networks, many challenges involve temporal graphs whose topology and attribute values evolve dynamically over time. Sophisticated and unknown network processes that affect temporal graphs cannot be captured adequately by prescribed models. Application areas include social mobility networks and catastrophic cybersecurity failures. These web-scale applications challenge current deep graph generative models with the need to capture 1) time-validity constraints, 2) time and topological distributions, and 3) joint time and graph encoding and decoding. Here, we propose the “Temporal Graph Generative Adversarial Network” (TG-GAN) for continuous-time graph generation with time-validity constraints 1. TG-GAN can jointly generate the time, node, and edge information for truncated temporal walks via a novel recurrent-based model and a valid time decoder. The generated truncated temporal walks are then assembled into time-budgeted temporal walks for temporal graphs under the learned topological and temporal dependencies. In addition, a discriminator is proposed to combine time and node encoding operations over a recurrent architecture to distinguish generated sequences from real ones sampled by a truncated temporal walk sampler. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that TG-GAN significantly outperforms five benchmarking methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.",3

Privacy policy is an important medium for users to understand what personal information has been collected and used.

It is thus important to detect compliance issues among regulations, e.g., GDPR, with privacy policies, and provide intuitive results for data subjects (i.e., users), data collection party (i.e., service providers) and the regulatory authorities.

Current state-of-the-art models have attempted to solve spatial sparsity with hierarchical gridding and model temporal relation with explicit time intervals, while some vital questions remain unsolved. Non-adjacent locations and non-consecutive visits provide non-trivial correlations for understanding a user’s behavior but were rarely considered. To aggregate all relevant visits from user trajectory and recall the most plausible candidates from weighted representations, here we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) for location recommendation. STAN explicitly exploits relative spatiotemporal information of all the check-ins with self-attention layers along the trajectory. This improvement allows a point-to-point interaction between non-adjacent locations and non-consecutive check-ins with explicit spatio-temporal effect. STAN uses a bi-layer attention architecture that firstly aggregates spatiotemporal correlation within user trajectory and then recalls the target with consideration of personalized item frequency (PIF). By visualization, we show that STAN is in line with the above intuition. Experimental results unequivocally show that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by 9-17%.",10

Recently, researchers paid considerable attention to fairness issues for artificial intelligence applications. Most of these approaches assumed independence of instances, and designed sophisticated models to eliminate the sensitive information to facilitate fairness. However, recommender systems differ greatly from these approaches as users and items naturally form a user-item bipartite graph, and are collaboratively correlated in the graph structure. In this paper, we propose a novel graph based technique for ensuring fairness of any recommendation models. Here, the fairness requirements refer to not exposing sensitive feature set in the user modeling process. Specifically, given the original embeddings from any recommendation models, we learn a composition of filters that transform each user’s and each item’s original embeddings into a filtered embedding space based on the sensitive feature set. For each user, this transformation is achieved under the adversarial learning of a user-centric graph, in order to obfuscate each sensitive feature between both the filtered user embedding and the sub graph structures of this user. Finally, extensive experimental results clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model for fair recommendation. We publish the source code at https://github.com/newlei/FairGo.",12

These posted reviews may have various associated properties, such as their length, their age since they were posted, or their rating of the item. However, it remains unclear how these different review properties contribute to the usefulness of their corresponding reviews in addressing the recommendation task. In particular, users show distinct preferences when considering different aspects of the reviews (i.e. properties) for making decisions about the items. Hence, it is important to model the relationship between the reviews’ properties and the usefulness of the reviews while learning the users’ preferences and the items’ attributes. In this paper, we propose to model the reviews with their associated available properties. We introduce a novel review properties-based recommendation model (RPRM) that learns which review properties are more important than others in capturing the usefulness of reviews, thereby enhancing the recommendation results. Furthermore, inspired by the users’ information adoption framework, we integrate two loss functions and a negative sampling strategy into our proposed RPRM model, to ensure that the properties of reviews are correlated with the users’ preferences. We examine the effectiveness of RPRM using the well-known Yelp and Amazon datasets. Our results show that RPRM significantly outperforms a classical and five existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we experimentally show the advantages of using our proposed loss functions and negative sampling strategy, which further enhance the recommendation performances of RPRM.",1

It significantly hurts model performance on tail items. To improve tail-item recommendation, we conduct research to transfer knowledge from head items to tail items, leveraging the rich user feedback in head items and the semantic connections between head and tail items. Specifically, we propose a novel dual transfer learning framework that jointly learns the knowledge transfer from both model-level and item-level: 1. The model-level knowledge transfer builds a generic meta-mapping of model parameters from few-shot to many-shot model. It captures the implicit data augmentation on the model-level to improve the representation learning of tail items. 2. The item-level transfer connects head and tail items through item-level features, to ensure a smooth transfer of meta-mapping from head items to tail items. The two types of transfers are incorporated to ensure the learned knowledge from head items can be well applied for tail item representation learning in the long-tail distribution settings. Through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, results show that our proposed dual transfer learning framework significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for tail item recommendation in hit ratio and NDCG. It is also very encouraging that our framework further improves head items and overall performance on top of the gains on tail items.",10

Trust and incentive are the two main issues that challenge cooperative computing between them. Another unique challenge in the EC environment is to facilitate trust and incentive in a decentralized manner. To tackle these challenges systematically, this paper proposes CoopEdge, a novel blockchain-based decentralized platform, to drive and support cooperative edge computing. On CoopEdge, an edge server can publish a computation task for other edge servers to contend for. A winner is selected from candidate edge servers based on their reputations.

In such settings, the underlying system undergoes a sequence of unobserved transitions among a finite set of hidden states. Furthermore, the relationships between the observed variables and their temporal dynamics may depend on the hidden state of the system. To further complicate matters, the hidden state sequences underlying the observed data from different individuals may not be aligned relative to a common frame of reference. Against this background, we consider the novel problem of jointly learning the state-dependent inter-variable relationships as well as the pattern of transitions between hidden states from multi-variate time series data. To solve this problem, we introduce the State-Regularized Vector Autoregressive Model (SrVARM) which combines a state-regularized recurrent neural network to learn the dynamics of transitions between discrete hidden states with an augmented autoregressive model which models the inter-variable dependencies in each state using a state-dependent directed acyclic graph (DAG).

Since a great number of creatives can be generated, it is difficult to accurately predict their CTR given a limited amount of feedback. Factorization machine (FM), which models inner product interaction between features, can be applied for the CTR prediction of creatives. However, interactions between creative elements may be more complex than the inner product, and the FM-estimated CTR may be of high variance due to limited feedback. To address these two issues, we propose an Automated Creative Optimization (AutoCO) framework to model complex interaction between creative elements and to balance between exploration and exploitation. Specifically, motivated by AutoML, we propose one-shot search algorithms for searching effective interaction functions between elements. We then develop stochastic variational inference to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters based on the reparameterization trick, and apply Thompson Sampling for efficiently exploring potentially better creatives.

Despite the tremendous manual and automatic efforts the community invested in the Wikidata project, the growing number of entities (now more than 100 million) presents multiple challenges in terms of knowledge gaps in the graph that are hard to track.

However, streaming 360° videos require high bandwidth, thus escalating the need for developing optimized streaming algorithms. Researchers have proposed various methods to tackle the problem, considering the network bandwidth or attempt to predict future viewports in advance. However, most of the existing works either (1) do not consider video contents to predict user viewport, or (2) do not adapt to user preferences dynamically, or (3) require a lot of training data for new videos, thus making them potentially unfit for video streaming purposes. We develop PARIMA, a fast and efficient online viewport prediction model that uses past viewports of users along with the trajectories of prime objects as a representative of video content to predict future viewports. We claim that the head movement of a user majorly depends upon the trajectories of the prime objects in the video. We employ a pyramid-based bitrate allocation scheme and perform a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of PARIMA. In our evaluation, we show that PARIMA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, improving the Quality of Experience by over 30% while maintaining a short response time.",4

In order to improve the relevance of generated results, conditional text generators were developed that use input keywords or attributes to produce the corresponding text. Prior work, however, do not finely control the diversity of automatically generated sentences. For example, it does not control the order of keywords to put more relevant ones first. Moreover, it does not explicitly control the balance between diversity and accuracy. To remedy these problems, we propose a fine-grained controllable generative model, called Apex, that uses an algorithm borrowed from automatic control (namely, a variant of the proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) controller) to precisely manipulate the diversity/accuracy trade-off of generated text. The algorithm is injected into a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), allowing Apex to control both (i) the order of keywords in the generated sentences (conditioned on the input keywords and their order), and (ii) the trade-off between diversity and accuracy. Evaluation results on real world datasets 1 show that the proposed method outperforms existing generative models in terms of diversity and relevance. Moreover, it achieves about 97% accuracy in the control of the order of keywords.",3

Here, we add nonlinearity to label spreading via nonlinear functions involving higher-order network structure, namely triangles in the graph. For a broad class of nonlinear functions, we prove convergence of our nonlinear higher-order label spreading algorithm to the global solution of an interpretable semi-supervised loss function.

Self-supervised network representation learning aims at extracting node embedding without external supervision. Recently, maximizing the mutual information between the local node embedding and the global summary (e.g. Deep Graph Infomax, or DGI for short) has shown promising results on many downstream tasks such as node classification. However, there are two major limitations of DGI. Firstly, DGI merely considers the extrinsic supervision signal (i.e., the mutual information between node embedding and global summary) while ignores the intrinsic signal (i.e., the mutual dependence between node embedding and node attributes). Secondly, nodes in a real-world network are usually connected by multiple edges with different relations, while DGI does not fully explore the various relations among nodes. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a novel framework, called High-order Deep Multiplex Infomax (HDMI), for learning node embedding on multiplex networks in a self-supervised way. To be more specific, we first design a joint supervision signal containing both extrinsic and intrinsic mutual information by high-order mutual information, and we propose a High-order Deep Infomax (HDI) to optimize the proposed supervision signal. Then we propose an attention based fusion module to combine node embedding from different layers of the multiplex network. Finally, we evaluate the proposed HDMI on various downstream tasks such as unsupervised clustering and supervised classification. The experimental results show that HDMI achieves state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.",13

We propose a novel model called Network of Tensor Time Series (NeT3), which is comprised of two modules, including Tensor Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN) and Tensor Recurrent Neural Network (TRNN). TGCN tackles the first challenge by generalizing Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for flat graphs to tensor graphs, which captures the synergy between multiple graphs associated with the tensors.

Different nodes in the neighborhood have different importance to the central node. Thus, average weight aggregation in most Graph Neural Networks would fail to model such difference. GAT-based models introduce the attention mechanism to solve this problem, but they ignore the rich structural information and may suffer from the problem of over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose Graph Neural Networks with STructural Adaptive Receptive fields (STAR-GNN), which adaptively construct a receptive field for each node with structural information and further achieve better aggregation of information. Firstly, we model local structural distribution based on anonymous random walks, followed by using the structural information to construct receptive fields guided with mutual information. Then, as the generated receptive fields are irregular, we design a sub-graph aggregator to boost node representations and theoretically prove that it has the ability to capture the complex structures in receptive fields. Experimental results demonstrate the power of STAR-GNN in learning structural receptive fields adaptively and encoding more informative structural characteristics in real-world networks.",1

It has a profound impact in a variety of applications ranging from finance, healthcare to social network analysis. Due to the unbearable labeling cost, existing methods are predominately developed in an unsupervised manner. Nonetheless, the anomalies they identify may turn out to be data noises or uninteresting data instances due to the lack of prior knowledge on the anomalies of interest. Hence, it is critical to investigate and develop few-shot learning for network anomaly detection. In real-world scenarios, few labeled anomalies are also easy to be accessed on similar networks from the same domain as of the target network, while most of the existing works omit to leverage them and merely focus on a single network. Taking advantage of this potential, in this work, we tackle the problem of few-shot network anomaly detection by (1) proposing a new family of graph neural networks – Graph Deviation Networks (GDN) that can leverage a small number of labeled anomalies for enforcing statistically significant deviations between abnormal and normal nodes on a network; and (2) equipping the proposed GDN with a new cross-network meta-learning algorithm to realize few-shot network anomaly detection by transferring meta-knowledge from multiple auxiliary networks.

Modeling user behavior with temporal networks has gained increasing attention in recent years since it allows capturing users’ dynamic preferences and predicting their next actions. Recently, some approaches have been proposed to model user behavior. However, these methods suffer from two problems: they work on static data, which ignores the dynamic evolution, or they model the whole behavior sequences directly by recurrent neural networks and thus suffer from noisy information. To tackle these problems, we propose a dynamic user behavior learning algorithm called LDBR. It views user behaviors as a set of dynamic events and uses recent event embedding to predict future user behavior and infer the current semantic labels. Specifically, we propose a new strategy to automatically learn a good event embedding in behavior sequence by introducing a smooth sampling strategy and minimizing the temporal link prediction error.",0

The analysis further motivates us to take a different approach than most existing works. Instead of using prior knowledge to create a new training task for fine-tuning BERT, we directly inject knowledge into BERT’s multi-head attention mechanism. This leads us to a simple yet effective approach that enjoys fast training stage as it saves the model from training on additional data or tasks other than the main task.

However, both real-world sleep behavior and job performance are difficult to measure at scale. In this work, we demonstrate that people’s everyday interactions with online mobile apps can reveal insights into their job performance in real-world contexts. We present an observational study in which we objectively tracked the sleep behavior and job performance of salespeople (N = 15) and athletes (N = 19) for 18 months, leveraging a mattress sensor and online mobile app to conduct the largest study of this kind to date. We first demonstrate that cumulative sleep measures are significantly correlated with job performance metrics, showing that an hour of daily sleep loss for a week was associated with a 9.0% average reduction in contracts established for salespeople and a 9.5% average reduction in game grade for the athletes. We then investigate the utility of online app interaction time as a passively collectible and scalable performance indicator. We show that app interaction time is correlated with the job performance of the athletes, but not the salespeople. To support that our app-based performance indicator truly captures meaningful variation in psychomotor function as it relates to sleep and is robust against potential confounds, we conducted a second study to evaluate the relationship between sleep behavior and app interaction time in a cohort of 274 participants. Using a generalized additive model to control for per-participant random effects, we demonstrate that participants who lost one hour of daily sleep for a week exhibited average app interaction times that were 5.0% slower. We also find that app interaction time exhibits meaningful chronobiologically consistent correlations with sleep history, time awake, and circadian rhythms.

Different from previous recommendations (e.g., item/group recommendation), promotion recommendation aims to select a set of K items based on all user preferences in selection phase and maximize the total revenue in delivery phase. Although these two phases are closely related with each other, existing methods usually focus on item selection in selection phase, largely ignoring the delivery phase and leading to sub-optimal performance. To solve the promotion recommendation problem, we propose the comb-K recommendation model, a constrained combinatorial optimization model which seamlessly integrates the selection phase and delivery phase with delicately designed constraints. When selecting K items, the comb-K recommendation is able to simultaneously search the optimal combination of item selection and delivery with the full consideration of all user preferences. Specifically, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph convolutional network to estimate user preference and propose the user-level comb-K recommendation model through solving a binary combination optimization problem. In order to handle combination explosion for large-scale users, we furtherly cluster massive users into limited groups and present a group-level comb-K recommendation model in which a novel heterogeneous graph pooling network is proposed to perform user clustering and estimate group preference. In addition, considering the ”long tail” phenomenon in e-commerce, we design a restricted neighbor heuristic search to accelerate the solving process. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of comb-K model for large-scale promotion recommendation. On billion-scale data, when clustering 2.5 × 107 users into 103 groups, our model is able to preserve 98.7% personalized preferences in group-level and significantly improves the Total Click and Hit Ratio by 9.35% and 7.14%, respectively.",2

There are generally two ways to mitigate the above-mentioned problems. One is to adopt transfer learning to leverage information from other domains; the other is to distill the “dark knowledge” from a large teacher model to small student models. The former usually employs parameter sharing mechanisms for knowledge transfer, but does not utilize the “dark knowledge” of pre-trained large models. The latter usually does not consider the cross-domain information from other domains. We argue that these two types of methods can be complementary to each other.

Experiments demonstrate that we can successfully convert discourse knowledge about eventualities from ASER, a large-scale discourse knowledge graph, into if-then commonsense knowledge defined in ATOMIC without any additional annotation effort. Further study suggests that DISCOS significantly outperforms previous supervised approaches in terms of novelty and diversity with comparable quality. In total, we can acquire 3.4M ATOMIC-like inferential commonsense knowledge by populating ATOMIC on the core part of ASER.

Especially, in an n-ary relational fact, the involved entities play different roles, e.g., the ternary relation PlayCharacterIn consists of three roles, Actor, Character and Movie. However, existing approaches are often directly extended from binary relational KBs, i.e., knowledge graphs, while missing the important semantic property of role. Therefore, we start from the role level, and propose a Role-Aware Modeling, RAM for short, for facts in n-ary relational KBs. RAM explores a latent space that contains basis vectors, and represents roles by linear combinations of these vectors. This way encourages semantically related roles to have close representations. RAM further introduces a pattern matrix that captures the compatibility between the role and all involved entities. To this end, it presents a multilinear scoring function to measure the plausibility of a fact composed by certain roles and entities. We show that RAM achieves both theoretical full expressiveness and computation efficiency, which also provides an elegant generalization for approaches in binary relational KBs. Experiments demonstrate that RAM outperforms representative baselines on both n-ary and binary relational datasets.",2

This paper aims to improve the UMLS Metathesaurus construction process by developing a novel supervised learning approach for improving the task of suggesting synonymous pairs that can scale to the size and diversity of the UMLS source vocabularies. We evaluate this deep learning (DL) approach against a rule-based approach (RBA) that approximates the current UMLS Metathesaurus construction process. The key to the generalizability of our approach is the use of various degrees of lexical similarity in negative pairs during the training process.",3

Despite its popularity in different domains, little is known about WebAssembly binaries that occur in the wild. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study of 8,461 unique WebAssembly binaries gathered from a wide range of sources, including source code repositories, package managers, and live websites. We study the security properties, source languages, and use cases of the binaries and how they influence the security of the WebAssembly ecosystem. Our findings update some previously held assumptions about real-world WebAssembly and highlight problems that call for future research. For example, we show that vulnerabilities that propagate from insecure source languages potentially affect a wide range of binaries (e.g., two thirds of the binaries are compiled from memory unsafe languages, such as C and C++) and that 21% of all binaries import potentially dangerous APIs from their host environment. We also show that cryptomining, which once accounted for the majority of all WebAssembly code, has been marginalized (less than 1% of all binaries found on the web) and gives way to a diverse set of use cases. Finally, 29% of all binaries on the web are minified, calling for techniques to decompile and reverse engineer WebAssembly. Overall, our results show that WebAssembly has left its infancy and is growing up into a language that powers a diverse ecosystem, with new challenges and opportunities for security researchers and practitioners. Besides these insights, we also share the dataset underlying our study, which is 58 times larger than the largest previously reported benchmark.",12

This research brings attention to the unexpected and diminished effect of fact-checking due to cognitive biases. We experimented (66,870 decisions) comparing the change in users’ stance toward unproven claims before and after being presented with a hypothetical fact-checked condition. We found that, first, the claims tagged with the ‘Lack of Evidence’ label are recognized similarly as false information unlike other borderline labels, indicating the presence of uncertainty-aversion bias in response to insufficient information. Second, users who initially show disapproval toward a claim are less likely to correct their views later than those who initially approve of the same claim when opposite fact-checking labels are shown — an indication of disapproval bias. Finally, user interviews revealed that users are more likely to share claims with Divided Evidence than those with Lack of Evidence among borderline messages, reaffirming the presence of uncertainty-aversion bias. On average, we confirm that fact-checking helps users correct their views and reduces the circulation of falsehoods by leading them to abandon extreme views.

We formulate the caption unit generation problem as a controlled captioning problem. Given a caption unit type as a control signal, a model generates an accurate caption unit of that type.

Running randomized controlled experiments is the gold standard in marketing incrementality measurement. Current literature and industry practices to run incrementality experiments focus on running placebo, intention-to-treat (ITT), or ghost bidding based experiments. A fundamental challenge with these is that the serving engine as treatment administrator is not blind to the user treatment assignment. Similarly, ITT and ghost bidding solutions provide greatly decreased precision since many experiment users never see ads. We present a novel randomized design solution for incrementality testing based on ghost bidding with improved measurement precision. Our design provides faster and cheaper results including double-blind, to the users and to the serving engine, post-auction experiment execution without ad targeting bias. We also identify ghost impressions in open ad exchanges by matching the bidding values or ads sent to external auctions with held-out bid values. This design leads to larger precision than ITT or current ghost bidding solutions. Our proposed design has been fully deployed in a real production system within a commercial programmatic ad network combined with a Demand Side Platform (DSP) that places ad bids in third-party ad exchanges. We have found reductions of up to 85% of the advertiser budget to reach statistical significance with typical ghost bids conversion and winner rates. Moreover, the highest statistical power at 50% control size design of this current practice is reached at 8% of our proposed design. By deploying this design, for an advertiser in the insurance industry, to measure the incrementality of display and native programmatic advertising, we have found conclusive evidence that the last-touch attribution framework (current industry standard) undervalues these channels by 87% when compared to the incremental conversions derived from the experiment.",2

The FmFM model can also be optimized further by caching the intermediate vectors, and it only takes thousands of floating-point operations (FLOPs) to make a prediction.

Yet it remains challenging to accurately appraise a property’s value. Prior works have primarily studied real estate valuation based on hedonic price models that take structured data into account while accompanying unstructured data is typically ignored. In this study, we investigate to what extent an automated visual analysis of apartment floor plans on online real estate platforms can enhance hedonic rent price appraisal. We propose a tailored two-staged deep learning approach to learn price-relevant designs of floor plans from historical price data. Subsequently, we integrate the floor plan predictions into hedonic rent price models that account for both structural and locational characteristics of an apartment. Our empirical analysis based on a unique dataset of 9,174 real estate listings suggests that current hedonic models underutilize the available data. We find that (1) the visual design of floor plans has significant explanatory power regarding rent prices – even after controlling for structural and locational apartment characteristics, and (2) harnessing floor plans results in an up to 10.56 % lower out-of-sample prediction error. We further find that floor plans yield a particularly high gain in prediction performance for older and smaller apartments. Altogether, our empirical findings contribute to the existing research body by establishing the link between the visual design of floor plans and real estate prices. Moreover, our approach has important implications for online real estate platforms, which can use our findings to enhance user experience in their real estate listings.",0

Users could have varied preferences on various ranking signals of an email, such as relevance and recency based on their tasks at hand and even their jobs. Thus a uniform matching pattern is not optimal for all users. Instead, an effective email ranker should conduct personalized ranking by taking users’ characteristics into account. Existing studies have explored user characteristics from various angles to make email search results personalized. However, little attention has been given to users’ search history for characterizing users. Although users’ historical behaviors have been shown to be beneficial as context in Web search, their effect in email search has not been studied and remains unknown. Given these observations, we propose to leverage user search history as query context to characterize users and build a context-aware ranking model for email search. In contrast to previous context-dependent ranking techniques that are based on raw texts, we use ranking features in the search history. This frees us from potential privacy leakage while giving a better generalization power to unseen users. Accordingly, we propose a context-dependent neural ranking model (CNRM) that encodes the ranking features in users’ search history as query context and show that it can significantly outperform the baseline neural model without using the context. We also investigate the benefit of the query context vectors obtained from CNRM on the state-of-the-art learning-to-rank model LambdaMart by clustering the vectors and incorporating the cluster information. Experimental results show that significantly better results can be achieved on LambdaMart as well, indicating that the query clusters can characterize different users and effectively turn the ranking model personalized.",1

To overcome this difficulty, in this paper, we propose a novel Partial-Softmax Loss based Deep Hashing, called PSLDH, to generate high-quality hash codes. Specifically, PSLDH first trains a category hashing network to generate a discriminative hash code for each category, and the hash code will preserve semantic information of the corresponding category well. Then, instead of defining the similarity between datapairs using their corresponding label vectors, we directly use the learned hash codes of categories to supervise the learning process of image hashing network, and a novel Partial-SoftMax loss is proposed to optimize the image hashing network.

The state of the art has primarily focused on learning hash codes that improve similarity search effectiveness, while assuming a brute-force linear scan strategy for searching over all the hash codes, even though much faster alternatives exist. One such alternative is multi-index hashing, an approach that constructs a smaller candidate set to search over, which depending on the distribution of the hash codes can lead to sub-linear search time. In this work, we propose Multi-Index Semantic Hashing (MISH), an unsupervised hashing model that learns hash codes that are both effective and highly efficient by being optimized for multi-index hashing. We derive novel training objectives, which enable to learn hash codes that reduce the candidate sets produced by multi-index hashing, while being end-to-end trainable. In fact, our proposed training objectives are model agnostic, i.e., not tied to how the hash codes are generated specifically in MISH, and are straight-forward to include in existing and future semantic hashing models. We experimentally compare MISH to state-of-the-art semantic hashing baselines in the task of document similarity search. We find that even though multi-index hashing also improves the efficiency of the baselines compared to a linear scan, they are still upwards of 33% slower than MISH, while MISH is still able to obtain state-of-the-art effectiveness.",3

Relevance is an essential requirement for e-commerce search, since showing products that do not match search query intent will degrade user experience. With the existence of vocabulary gap between user language of queries and seller language of products, measuring semantic relevance is necessary and neural networks are engaged to address this task. However, semantic relevance is different from click-through rate prediction in that no direct training signal is available. Most previous attempts learn relevance models from user click-through data that are cheap and abundant. Unfortunately, click behavior is noisy and misleading, which is affected by not only relevance but also factors including price, image and attractive titles. Therefore, it is challenging but valuable to learn relevance models from click-through data. In this paper, we propose a new relevance learning framework that concentrates on how to train a relevance model from the weak supervision of click-through data. Different from previous efforts that treat samples as either relevant or irrelevant, we construct more fine-grained samples for training.

In contrast with general hashing that generates low-dimensional hash codes, the high-dimensional sparse hashing maps inputs into a higher dimensional space and generates sparse hash codes, achieving superior performance. However, the sparse hashing has not been fully studied in hashing literature yet. For example, how to fully explore the power of sparse coding in cross-modal retrieval tasks; how to discretely solve the binary and sparse constraints so as to avoid the quantization error problem. Motivated by these issues, in this paper, we present an efficient sparse hashing method, i.e., High-dimensional Sparse Cross-modal Hashing, HSCH for short. It not only takes the high-level semantic similarity of data into consideration, but also properly exploits the low-level feature similarity. In specific, we theoretically design a fine-grained similarity with two critical fusion rules. Then we take advantage of sparse codes to embed the fine-grained similarity into the to-be-learnt hash codes. Moreover, an efficient discrete optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the binary and sparse constraints, reducing the quantization error. In light of this, it becomes much more trainable, and the learnt hash codes are more discriminative. More importantly, the retrieval complexity of HSCH is as efficient as general hash methods. Extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HSCH compared with several state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing approaches.",2

Link prediction, as one of the key problems for network-structured data, aims to predict whether there exists a link between two nodes. The traditional approaches are based on the explicit similarity computation between the compact node representation by embedding each node into a low-dimensional space. In order to efficiently handle the intensive similarity computation in link prediction, the hashing technique has been successfully used to produce the node representation in the Hamming space. However, the hashing-based link prediction algorithms face accuracy loss from the randomized hashing techniques or inefficiency from the learning to hash techniques in the embedding process. Currently, the Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework has been widely applied to the graph-related tasks in an end-to-end manner, but it commonly requires substantial computational resources and memory costs due to massive parameter learning, which makes the GNN-based algorithms impractical without the help of a powerful workhorse. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective model called #GNN, which balances the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. #GNN is able to efficiently acquire node representation in the Hamming space for link prediction by exploiting the randomized hashing technique to implement message passing and capture high-order proximity in the GNN framework. Furthermore, we characterize the discriminative power of #GNN in probability. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed #GNN algorithm achieves accuracy comparable to the learning-based algorithms and outperforms the randomized algorithm, while running significantly faster than the learning-based algorithms. Also, the proposed algorithm shows excellent scalability on a large-scale network with the limited resources.",3

This study presents a new method, multi-view graph contrastive representation learning for drug-drug interaction prediction, MIRACLE for brevity, to capture inter-view molecule structure and intra-view interactions between molecules simultaneously. MIRACLE treats a DDI network as a multi-view graph where each node in the interaction graph itself is a drug molecular graph instance. We use GCN to encode DDI relationships and a bond-aware attentive message propagating method to capture drug molecular structure information in the MIRACLE learning stage.

Most of the existing works predict unobserved links using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn node embeddings upon pair-wise relations. Despite promising results given enough observed links, these models are still challenging to achieve heart-stirring performance when observed links are extremely limited. The main reason is that they only focus on the smoothness of node representations on pair-wise relations. Unfortunately, this assumption may fall when the networks do not have enough observed links to support it. To this end, we go beyond pair-wise relations and propose a new and novel framework using hypergraph neural networks with multi-level hyperedge distillation strategies. To break through the limitations of sparsely observed links, we introduce the hypergraph to uncover higher-level relations, which is exceptionally crucial to deduce unobserved links. A hypergraph allows one edge to connect multiple nodes, making it easier to learn better higher-level relations for link prediction. To overcome the restrictions of manually designed hypergraphs, which is constant in most hypergraph researches, we propose a new method to learn high-quality hyperedges using three novel hyperedges distillation strategies automatically. The generated hyperedges are hierarchical and follow the power-law distribution, which can significantly improve the link prediction performance. To predict unobserved links, we present a novel hypergraph neural networks named HNN. HNN takes the multi-level hypergraphs as input and makes the node embeddings smooth on hyperedges instead of pair-wise links only. Extensive evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate our model’s superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, especially when the observed links are extremely reduced.",5

Many of the existing methods focus on obtaining a static vector representation for a node in a way that is agnostic to the downstream application where it is being used. In practice, however, downstream tasks such as link prediction require specific contextual information that can be extracted from the subgraphs related to the nodes provided as input to the task. To tackle this challenge, we develop , a framework for bridging static representation learning methods using global information from the entire graph with localized attention driven mechanisms to learn contextual node representations. We first pre-train our model in a self-supervised manner by introducing higher-order semantic associations and masking nodes, and then fine-tune our model for a specific link prediction task. Instead of training node representations by aggregating information from all semantic neighbors connected via metapaths, we automatically learn the composition of different metapaths that characterize the context for a specific task without the need for any pre-defined metapaths. significantly outperforms both static and contextual embedding learning methods on several publicly available benchmark network datasets. We also demonstrate the interpretability, effectiveness of contextual learning, and the scalability of through extensive evaluation.",9

In this new scenario, one of the most important problems is to predict the value of a community formed by closely connected users in social networks due to its tremendous business value. However, few works have addressed this problem because of 1) its novel setting and 2) its challenging nature that the structure of a community has complex effects on its value. To bridge this gap, we develop a Multi-scale Structure-aware Community value prediction network (MSC) that jointly models the structural information of different scales, including peer relations, community structure, and inter-community connections, to predict the value of given communities. Specifically, we first proposed a Masked Edge Learning Graph Convolutional Network (MEL-GCN) based on a novel masked propagation mechanism to model peer influence. Then, we design a Pair-wise Community Pooling (PCPool) module to capture critical community structures. Finally, we model the inter-community connections by distinguishing intra-community edges from inter-community edges and employing a Multi-aggregator Framework (MAF). Extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world social e-commerce dataset demonstrate our method’s superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, with a relative performance gain of 11.40%, 10.01%, and 10.97% in MAE, RMSE, and NRMSE, respectively.

While new-coming users continuously arrive in the real world, one crucial task is to have inductive SR that can produce embeddings of users and items without re-training. Given user-item interactions can be extremely sparse, another critical task is to have transferable SR that can transfer the knowledge derived from one domain with rich data to another domain. In this work, we aim to present the holistic SR that simultaneously accommodates conventional, inductive, and transferable settings. We propose a novel deep learning-based model, Relational Temporal Attentive Graph Neural Networks (RetaGNN), for holistic SR. The main idea of RetaGNN is three-fold. First, to have inductive and transferable capabilities, we train a relational attentive GNN on the local subgraph extracted from a user-item pair, in which the learnable weight matrices are on various relations among users, items, and attributes, rather than nodes or edges. Second, long-term and short-term temporal patterns of user preferences are encoded by a proposed sequential self-attention mechanism. Third, a relation-aware regularization term is devised for better training of RetaGNN. Experiments conducted on MovieLens, Instagram, and Book-Crossing datasets exhibit that RetaGNN can outperform state-of-the-art methods under conventional, inductive, and transferable settings. The derived attention weights also bring model explainability.",6

However, observational interaction data could result from users’ conformity towards popular items, which entangles users’ real interest. Existing methods tracks this problem as eliminating popularity bias, e.g., by re-weighting training samples or leveraging a small fraction of unbiased data. However, the variety of user conformity is ignored by these approaches, and different causes of an interaction are bundled together as unified representations, hence robustness and interpretability are not guaranteed when underlying causes are changing. In this paper, we present DICE, a general framework that learns representations where interest and conformity are structurally disentangled, and various backbone recommendation models could be smoothly integrated. We assign users and items with separate embeddings for interest and conformity, and make each embedding capture only one cause by training with cause-specific data which is obtained according to the colliding effect of causal inference. Our proposed methodology outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with remarkable improvements on two real-world datasets on top of various backbone models. We further demonstrate that the learned embeddings successfully capture the desired causes, and show that DICE guarantees the robustness and interpretability of recommendation.",19

Existing sequential recommenders consider the sequential correlations between historically interacted items for capturing users’ historical preferences. However, since users’ preferences are by nature time-evolving and diversified, solely modeling the historical preference (without being aware of the time-evolving trends of preferences) can be inferior for recommending complementary or fresh items and thus hurt the effectiveness of recommender systems. In this paper, we bridge the gap between the past preference and potential future preference by proposing the future-aware diverse trends (FAT) framework. By future-aware, for each inspected user, we construct the future sequences from other similar users, which comprise of behaviors that happen after the last behavior of the inspected user, based on a proposed neighbor behavior extractor. By diverse trends, supposing the future preferences can be diversified, we propose the diverse trends extractor and the time-aware mechanism to represent the possible trends of preferences for a given user with multiple vectors. We leverage both the representations of historical preference and possible future trends to obtain the final recommendation. The quantitative and qualitative results from relatively extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed framework not only outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods across various metrics, but also makes complementary and fresh recommendations.",6

As user-item interactions can be naturally modelled as graph-structured data, variants of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have become a well-established building block in the latest recommenders. Due to the wide utilization of sensitive user profile data, existing recommendation paradigms are likely to expose users to the threat of privacy breach, and GCN-based recommenders are no exception. Apart from the leakage of raw user data, the fragility of current recommenders under inference attacks offers malicious attackers a backdoor to estimate users’ private attributes via their behavioral footprints and the recommendation results. However, little attention has been paid to developing recommender systems that can defend such attribute inference attacks, and existing works achieve attack resistance by either sacrificing considerable recommendation accuracy or only covering specific attack models or protected information. In our paper, we propose GERAI, a novel differentially private graph convolutional network to address such limitations. Specifically, in GERAI, we bind the information perturbation mechanism in differential privacy with the recommendation capability of graph convolutional networks. Furthermore, based on local differential privacy and functional mechanism, we innovatively devise a dual-stage encryption paradigm to simultaneously enforce privacy guarantee on users’ sensitive features and the model optimization process. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GERAI in terms of its resistance to attribute inference attacks and recommendation effectiveness.",9

Most of them empirically allocate a unified dimension to all feature fields, which is memory inefficient. Thus it is highly desired to assign various embedding dimensions to different feature fields according to their importance and predictability. Due to the large amounts of feature fields and the nuanced relationship between embedding dimensions with feature distributions and neural network architectures, manually allocating embedding dimensions in practical recommender systems can be challenging. To this end, we propose an AutoML-based framework (AutoDim) in this paper, which can automatically select dimensions for different feature fields in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we first proposed an end-to-end differentiable framework that can calculate the weights over various dimensions in a soft and continuous manner for feature fields, and an AutoML-based optimization algorithm; then, we derive a hard and discrete embedding component architecture according to the maximal weights and retrain the whole recommender framework.

As a research problem, quality estimation (QE) aims to directly estimate the quality of translation in a given pair of source and target sentences, and highlight the words that need corrections, without referencing to golden translations. In this paper, we propose Verdi, a novel framework for word-level and sentence-level post-editing effort estimation for bilingual corpora. Verdi adopts two word predictors to enable diverse features to be extracted from a pair of sentences for subsequent quality estimation, including a transformer-based neural machine translation (NMT) model and a pre-trained cross-lingual language model (XLM). We exploit the symmetric nature of bilingual corpora and apply model-level dual learning in the NMT predictor, which handles a primal task and a dual task simultaneously with weight sharing, leading to stronger context prediction ability than single-direction NMT models. By taking advantage of the dual learning scheme, we further design a novel feature to directly encode the translated target information without relying on the source context. Extensive experiments conducted on WMT20 QE tasks demonstrate that our method beats the winner of the competition and outperforms other baseline methods by a great margin. We further use the sentence-level scores provided by Verdi to clean a parallel corpus and observe benefits on both model performance and training efficiency.",0

It leverages the fact that Wikipedia articles link to each other and are mapped to concepts in the Wikidata knowledge base, such that, when represented as bags of links, articles are inherently language-independent. WikiPDA works in two steps, by first densifying bags of links using matrix completion and then training a standard monolingual topic model. A human evaluation shows that WikiPDA produces more coherent topics than monolingual text-based latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), thus offering crosslinguality at no cost. We demonstrate WikiPDA’s utility in two applications: a study of topical biases in 28 Wikipedia language editions, and crosslingual supervised document classification. Finally, we highlight WikiPDA’s capacity for zero-shot language transfer, where a model is reused for new languages without any fine-tuning.

However, existing encoder-decoder summarization models have difficulty learning the latent alignment between source documents and summaries because of their vast disparity in length. In this paper, we propose a extractor-abstractor framework in which the keyword-based extractor selects a few sets of salient sentences from the input document and then the abstractor paraphrases these sets of sentences in parallel, which are more aligned to the summary, to generate the final summary. The new extractor and abstractor are pretrained from a set of “pseudo summaries” extracted by specially designed heuristics, and then further trained together in a reinforcement learning framework. The results show that the proposed model generates high-quality summaries with faster training speed and less training memory footprint, and outperforms the state-of-the-art models on CNN/Daily Mail, Webis-TLDR-17, Webis-Snippet-20, WikiHow and DUC-2002 datasets.",1

However, despite a few exceptions, most of the previous work in this line of research does not consider the underlying topical semantics inherited in document contents and the relation graph, making the representations less effective and hard to interpret. In a few recent studies trying to incorporate latent topics into GNNs, the topics have been learned independently from the relation graph modeling. Intuitively, topic extraction can benefit much from the information propagation of the relation graph structure - directly and indirectly connected documents and words have similar topics. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Topic Neural Network (GTNN) model to mine latent topic semantics for interpretable document representation learning, taking into account the document-document, document-word, and word-word relationships in the graph. We also show that our model can be viewed as semi-amortized inference for relational topic model based on Poisson distribution, with high order correlations.

CDN providers typically collect various multivariate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) time series to monitor and diagnose system performance. State-of-the-art anomaly detection methods mostly use deep learning to extract the normal patterns of data, due to its superior performance. However, KPI data usually exhibit non-additive Gaussian noise, which makes it difficult for deep learning models to learn the normal patterns, resulting in degraded performance in anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose a robust and noise-resilient anomaly detection mechanism using multivariate KPIs. Our key insight is that different KPIs are constrained by certain time-invariant characteristics of the underlying system, and that explicitly modelling such invariance may help resist noise in the data. We thus propose a novel anomaly detection method called SDFVAE, short for Static and Dynamic Factorized VAE, that learns the representations of KPIs by explicitly factorizing the latent variables into dynamic and static parts. Extensive experiments using real-world data show that SDFVAE achieves a F1-score ranging from 0.92 to 0.99 on both regular and noisy dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",1

Although various QoS prediction methods have been proposed, few of them have taken outliers into consideration, which may dramatically degrade the prediction performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose an outlier-resilient QoS prediction method in this paper. Our method utilizes Cauchy loss to measure the discrepancy between the observed QoS values and the predicted ones. Owing to the robustness of Cauchy loss, our method is resilient to outliers. We further extend our method to provide time-aware QoS prediction results by taking the temporal information into consideration.

This paper builds a collaborative deep inference system between a resource-constrained mobile device and a powerful edge server, aiming at joining the power of both on-device processing and computation offloading. The basic idea of this system is to partition a deep neural network (DNN) into a front-end part running on the mobile device and a back-end part running on the edge server, with the key challenge being how to locate the optimal partition point to minimize the end-to-end inference delay. Unlike existing efforts on DNN partitioning that rely heavily on a dedicated offline profiling stage to search for the optimal partition point, our system has a built-in online learning module, called Autodidactic Neurosurgeon (ANS), to automatically learn the optimal partition point on-the-fly. Therefore, ANS is able to closely follow the changes of the system environment by generating new knowledge for adaptive decision making. The core of ANS is a novel contextual bandit learning algorithm, called μLinUCB, which not only has provable theoretical learning performance guarantee but also is ultra-lightweight for easy real-world implementation.

The current shell for spatiotemporal predictions often relies heavily on the quality of handcraft, fixed graphical structures, however, we argue that such a paradigm could be expensive and sub-optimal in many applications. To raise the bar, this paper proposes to jointly mine the spatial dependencies and model temporal patterns in a coupled framework, i.e., to make spatiotemporal-coupled predictions. We come up with a novel Reciprocal SpatioTemporal (REST) framework, which introduces Edge Inference Networks (EINs) to couple with GCNs. From the temporal side to the spatial side, EINs infer spatial dependencies among time series vertices and generate multi-modal directed weighted graphs to serve GCNs. And from the temporal side to the spatial side, GCNs utilize these spatial dependencies to make predictions and then introduce feedback to optimize EINs. The REST framework is incrementally trained for higher performance of spatiotemporal prediction, powered by the reciprocity between its comprised two components from such an iterative joint learning process. Additionally, to maximize the power of the REST framework, we design a phased heuristic approach, which effectively stabilizes training procedure and prevents early-stop.

In this paper, we argue that these models fail to anticipate changing preferences. To overcome this issue, we seek to understand the structure that underlies the evolution of user preferences. To this end, we propose the Preference Transition Model (PTM), a dynamic model for user preferences towards classes of items. The model enables the estimation of transition probabilities between classes of items over time, which can be used to estimate how users’ tastes are expected to evolve based on their past history. We test our model’s predictive performance on a number of different prediction tasks on data from three different domains: music streaming, restaurant recommendations and movie recommendations, and find that it outperforms competing approaches. We then focus on a music application, and inspect the structure learned by our model. We find that the PTM uncovers remarkable regularities in users’ preference trajectories over time. We believe that these findings could inform a new generation of dynamic, diversity-enhancing recommender systems.",0

Most conventional methods cope with this issue by adopting a pairwise ranking approach with negative sampling. However, the pairwise ranking approach has a severe disadvantage in the convergence time owing to the quadratically increasing computational cost with respect to the sample size; it is problematic, particularly for large-scale datasets and complex models such as neural networks. By contrast, a pointwise approach does not directly solve a ranking problem, and is therefore inferior to a pairwise counterpart in top-K ranking tasks; however, it is generally advantageous in regards to the convergence time. This study aims to establish an approach to learn personalised ranking from implicit feedback, which reconciles the training efficiency of the pointwise approach and ranking effectiveness of the pairwise counterpart. The key idea is to estimate the ranking of items in a pointwise manner; we first reformulate the conventional pointwise approach based on density ratio estimation and then incorporate the essence of ranking-oriented approaches (e.g. the pairwise approach) into our formulation. Through experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach dramatically reduces the convergence time (one to two orders of magnitude faster) and significantly improves the ranking performance.",2

There are three major challenges facing OTPs: sparsity, diversity, and implicitness. In this paper, we present a novel Fliggy ITinerary-aware deep matching NETwork (FitNET) to address these three challenges. FitNET is designed based on the popular deep matching network, which has been successfully employed in many industrial recommendation systems, due to its effectiveness. The concept itinerary is firstly proposed under the context of recommendation systems for OTPs, which is defined as the list of unconsumed orders of a user. All orders in a user itinerary are learned as a whole, based on which the implicit travel intention of each user can be more accurately inferred. To alleviate the sparsity problem, users’ profiles are incorporated into FitNET. Meanwhile, a series of itinerary-aware attention mechanisms that capture the vital interactions between user’s itinerary and other input categories are carefully designed. These mechanisms are very helpful in inferring a user’s travel intention or preference, and handling the diversity in a user’s need. Further, two training objectives, i.e., prediction accuracy of user’s travel intention and prediction accuracy of user’s click behavior, are utilized by FitNET, so that these two objectives can be optimized simultaneously. An offline experiment on Fliggy production dataset with over 0.27 million users and 1.55 million travel items, and an online A/B test both show that FitNET effectively learns users’ travel intentions, preferences, and diverse needs, based on their itineraries and gains superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. FitNET now has been successfully deployed at Fliggy, serving major online traffic.",0

Commonly, the metadata of the given documents and the hierarchy of the labels are available in real-world applications. However, most existing studies focus on only modeling the text information, with a few attempts to utilize either metadata or hierarchy signals, but not both of them. In this paper, we bridge the gap by formalizing the problem of metadata-aware text classification in a large label hierarchy (e.g., with tens of thousands of labels). To address this problem, we present the MATCH1 solution—an end-to-end framework that leverages both metadata and hierarchy information. To incorporate metadata, we pre-train the embeddings of text and metadata in the same space and also leverage the fully-connected attentions to capture the interrelations between them. To leverage the label hierarchy, we propose different ways to regularize the parameters and output probability of each child label by its parents. Extensive experiments on two massive text datasets with large-scale label hierarchies demonstrate the effectiveness of MATCH over the state-of-the-art deep learning baselines.",5

Considering the ever-evolving Web data and new emerging categories, instead of the laborious supervised setting, in this paper, we focus on the minimally-supervised setting that aims to categorize documents effectively, with a couple of seed documents annotated per category. We recognize that texts collected from the Web are often structure-rich, i.e., accompanied by various metadata. One can easily organize the corpus into a text-rich network, joining raw text documents with document attributes, high-quality phrases, label surface names as nodes, and their associations as edges. Such a network provides a holistic view of the corpus’ heterogeneous data sources and enables a joint optimization for network-based analysis and deep textual model training. We therefore propose a novel framework for minimally supervised categorization by learning from the text-rich network. Specifically, we jointly train two modules with different inductive biases – a text analysis module for text understanding and a network learning module for class-discriminative, scalable network learning. Each module generates pseudo training labels from the unlabeled document set, and both modules mutually enhance each other by co-training using pooled pseudo labels. We test our model on two real-world datasets. On the challenging e-commerce product categorization dataset with 683 categories, our experiments show that given only three seed documents per category, our framework can achieve an accuracy of about 92%, significantly outperforming all compared methods; our accuracy is only less than 2% away from the supervised BERT model trained on about 50K labeled documents.",3

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for large-scale multi-view clustering to overcome the above challenges. Our approach focuses on learning the low-dimensional binary embedding of multi-view data, preserving the samples’ local structure during binary embedding, and optimizing the embedding and clustering in a unified framework. Furthermore, we proposed to learn the parameters using a combination of data-driven and heuristic approaches.

Siddique, Fuad Jamour, Vagelis Hristidis, ","Slot filling is identifying contiguous spans of words in an utterance that correspond to certain parameters (i.e., slots) of a user request/query. Slot filling is one of the most important challenges in modern task-oriented dialog systems. Supervised approaches have proven effective at tackling this challenge, but they need a significant amount of labeled training data in a given domain. However, new domains (i.e., unseen in training) may emerge after deployment. Thus, it is imperative that these models seamlessly adapt and fill slots from both seen and unseen domains – unseen domains contain unseen slot types with no training data, and even seen slots in unseen domains are typically presented in different contexts. This setting is commonly referred to as zero-shot slot filling. Little work has focused on this setting, with limited experimental evaluation. Existing models that mainly rely on context-independent embedding-based similarity measures fail to detect slot values in unseen domains or do so only partially. We propose a new zero-shot slot filling neural model, , which works in three steps. Step one acquires domain-oblivious, context-aware representations of utterance words by exploiting (a) linguistic features such as part-of-speech tags; (b) named entity recognition cues; and (c) contextual embeddings from pre-trained language models. Step two fine-tunes these rich representations and produces slot-independent tags for each word. Step three exploits generalizable context-aware utterance-slot similarity features at the word level, uses slot-independent tags, and contextualizes them to produce slot-specific predictions for each word. Our thorough evaluation on four diverse public datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models by 17.52%, 22.15%, 17.42%, and 17.95% on average for unseen domains on SNIPS, ATIS, MultiWOZ, and SGD datasets, respectively.",4

The taxonomy expansion task aims to find a position for a new term in an existing taxonomy to capture the emerging knowledge in the world and keep the taxonomy dynamically updated. Previous taxonomy expansion solutions neglect valuable information brought by the hierarchical structure and evaluate the correctness of merely an added edge, which downgrade the problem to node-pair scoring or mini-path classification. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchy Expansion Framework (HEF), which fully exploits the hierarchical structure’s properties to maximize the coherence of expanded taxonomy. HEF makes use of taxonomy’s hierarchical structure in multiple aspects: i) HEF utilizes subtrees containing most relevant nodes as self-supervision data for a complete comparison of parental and sibling relations; ii) HEF adopts a coherence modeling module to evaluate the coherence of a taxonomy’s subtree by integrating hypernymy relation detection and several tree-exclusive features; iii) HEF introduces the Fitting Score for position selection, which explicitly evaluates both path and level selections and takes full advantage of parental relations to interchange information for disambiguation and self-correction. Extensive experiments show that by better exploiting the hierarchical structure and optimizing taxonomy’s coherence, HEF vastly surpasses the prior state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets by an average improvement of 46.7% in accuracy and 32.3% in mean reciprocal rank.",2

Knowledge graph potential and the demand for ecosystems to facilitate their creation, curation, and understanding, is testified in diverse domains, e.g., biomedicine. The Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is the W3C recommendation language for integrity constraints over RDF knowledge graphs. Enabling quality assements of knowledge graphs, SHACL is rapidly gaining attention in real-world scenarios. SHACL models integrity constraints as a network of shapes, where a shape contains the constraints to be fullfiled by the same entities.

We present Trav-SHACL, a SHACL engine capable of planning the traversal and execution of a shape schema in a way that invalid entities are detected early and needless validations are minimized. Trav-SHACL reorders the shapes in a shape schema for efficient validation and rewrites target and constraint queries for fast detection of invalid entities. Trav-SHACL is empirically evaluated on 27 testbeds executed against knowledge graphs of up to 34M triples.

To this end, we first organize the EHR data into a heterogeneous graph that is capable of modeling complex interactions among users, symptoms and diseases, and tailor the graph representation learning towards disease diagnosis with an inductive learning paradigm. Then, we build a disease self-diagnosis system with a corresponding EHR Graph-based Symptom Retrieval System (GraphRet) that can search and provide a list of relevant alternative symptoms by tracing the predefined meta-paths.

However, experimental settings, such as social networks, where users are interacting and influencing one another, may violate conventional assumptions of no interference for credible causal inference. Existing solutions to the network setting include accounting for the fraction or count of treated neighbors in a user’s network, yet most current methods do not account for the local network structure beyond simply counting the number of neighbors. Our study provides an approach that accounts for both the local structure in a user’s social network via motifs as well as the treatment assignment conditions of neighbors. We propose a two-part approach. We first introduce and employ “causal network motifs”, which are network motifs that characterize the assignment conditions in local ego networks; and then we propose a tree-based algorithm for identifying different network interference conditions and estimating their average potential outcomes. Our approach can account for social network theories, such as structural diversity and echo chambers, and also can help specify network interference conditions that are suitable to each experiment. We test our method on a synthetic network setting and on a real-world experiment on a large-scale network, which highlight how accounting for local structures can better account for different interference patterns in networks.",2

The complexity and streaming nature of social messages make it appealing to address social event detection in an incremental learning setting, where acquiring, preserving, and extending knowledge are major concerns. Most existing methods, including those based on incremental clustering and community detection, learn limited amounts of knowledge as they ignore the rich semantics and structural information contained in social data. Moreover, they cannot memorize previously acquired knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge-Preserving Incremental Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (KPGNN) for incremental social event detection. To acquire more knowledge, KPGNN models complex social messages into unified social graphs to facilitate data utilization and explores the expressive power of GNNs for knowledge extraction. To continuously adapt to the incoming data, KPGNN adopts contrastive loss terms that cope with a changing number of event classes. It also leverages the inductive learning ability of GNNs to efficiently detect events and extends its knowledge from previously unseen data. To deal with large social streams, KPGNN adopts a mini-batch subgraph sampling strategy for scalable training, and periodically removes obsolete data to maintain a dynamic embedding space. KPGNN requires no feature engineering and has few hyperparameters to tune. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the superiority of KPGNN over various baselines.",19

Specifically, we retrieve informative knowledge triples from ConceptNet and perform knowledge-aware reasoning while tracking the entities. Besides, we employ a multi-stage training schema which fine-tunes the BERT model over unlabeled data collected from Wikipedia before further fine-tuning it on the final model. Experimental results on two procedural text datasets, ProPara and Recipes, verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, in which our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison to various baselines.1",4

Event representation learning has been proposed and successfully applied to this task. Most previous methods learning representations mainly focus on coarse-grained connections at event or chain level, while ignoring more fine-grained connections between events. Here we propose a novel framework which can enhance the representation learning of events by mining their connections at multiple granularity levels, including argument level, event level and chain level. In our method, we first employ a masked self-attention mechanism to model the relations between the components of events (i.e. arguments). Then, a directed graph convolutional network is further utilized to model the temporal or causal relations between events in the chain. Finally, we introduce an attention module to the context event chain, so as to dynamically aggregate context events with respect to the current candidate event. By fusing threefold connections in a unified framework, our approach can learn more accurate argument/event/chain representations, and thus leads to better prediction performance. Comprehensive experiment results on public New York Times corpus demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available in https://github.com/YueAWu/MCer.",0

Such systems can retain knowledge from learned tasks in a knowledge base and seamlessly apply it to improve the future learning. Unfortunately, most existing LML methods require labels in every task, whereas providing persistent human labeling for all future tasks is costly, onerous, error-prone, and hence impractical. Motivated by this situation, we propose a new paradigm named unsupervised lifelong learning with curricula (ULLC), where only one task needs to be labeled for initialization and the system then performs lifelong learning for subsequent tasks in an unsupervised fashion. A main challenge of realizing this paradigm lies in the occurrence of negative knowledge transfer, where partial old knowledge becomes detrimental for learning a given task yet cannot be filtered out by the learner without the help of labels. To overcome this challenge, we draw insights from the learning behaviors of humans. Specifically, when faced with a difficult task that cannot be well tackled by our current knowledge, we usually postpone it and work on some easier tasks first, which allows us to grow our knowledge. Thereafter, once we go back to the postponed task, we are more likely to tackle it well as we are more knowledgeable now. The key idea of ULLC is similar – at any time, a pool of candidate tasks are organized in a curriculum by their distances to the knowledge base. The learner then starts from the closer tasks, accumulates knowledge from learning them, and moves to learn the faraway tasks with a gradually augmented knowledge base. The viability and effectiveness of our proposal are substantiated through extensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real datasets.",1

Specifically, TaSeLF mines the taxonomy-aware distance relations to increases the training examples, which alleviates the generalization bottleneck brought by the insufficient data. TaPN introduces the Poincaré embeddings to represent the label taxonomy, and integrates them into a task-adaptive projection networks, which tackles problems of the class centroids distribution and the taxonomy-aware embedding distribution in the vanilla prototypical networks.",1

Many patients suffer from life-threatening systemic problems and need to be carefully monitored in ICUs. An intelligent prognosis can help physicians take an early intervention, prevent adverse outcomes, and optimize the medical resource allocation, which is urgently needed, especially in this ongoing global pandemic crisis. However, in the early stage of the epidemic outbreak, the data available for analysis is limited due to the lack of effective diagnostic mechanisms, the rarity of the cases, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a distilled transfer learning framework, which leverages the existing publicly available online Electronic Medical Records to enhance the prognosis for inpatients with emerging infectious diseases. It learns to embed the COVID-19-related medical features based on massive existing EMR data. The transferred parameters are further trained to imitate the teacher model’s representation based on distillation, which embeds the health status more comprehensively on the source dataset. We conduct Length-of-Stay prediction experiments for patients in ICUs on real-world COVID-19 datasets. The experiment results indicate that our proposed model consistently outperforms competitive baseline methods. In order to further verify the scalability of o deal with different clinical tasks on different EMR datasets, we conduct an additional mortality prediction experiment on End-Stage Renal Disease datasets.

This allows local institutions to understand better the predictive reasoning of the black-box model in its own local context or to further customize the distilled knowledge with its private dataset that cannot be centralized and fed into the server model. The proposed method thus addresses several challenges of deploying machine learning (ML) in many industrial settings (e.g., healthcare analytics) with strong proprietary constraints. These include: (1) the opaqueness of the server model’s architecture which prevents local users from understanding its predictive reasoning in their local data contexts; (2) the increasing cost and risk of uploading local data on the cloud for analysis; and (3) the need to customize the server model with private onsite data. We evaluated the proposed method on both benchmark and real-world healthcare data where significant improvements over existing local distillation methods were observed.

However, directly training and evaluating a new RL-based recommendation algorithm needs to collect users’ real-time feedback in the real system, which is time/effort consuming and could negatively impact users’ experiences. Thus, it calls for a user simulator that can mimic real users’ behaviors to pre-train and evaluate new recommendation algorithms. Simulating users’ behaviors in a dynamic system faces immense challenges – (i) the underlying item distribution is complex, and (ii) historical logs for each user are limited. In this paper, we develop a user simulator based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). To be specific, the generator captures the underlying distribution of users’ historical logs and generates realistic logs that can be considered as augmentations of real logs; while the discriminator not only distinguishes real and fake logs but also predicts users’ behaviors. The experimental results based on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed simulator.",0

Merchants on e-commerce platforms would like their items to appear as high as possible in the top-N of these ranked lists. In this paper, we demonstrate how unscrupulous merchants can create item images that artificially promote their products, improving their rankings. Recommender systems that use images to address the cold start problem are vulnerable to this security risk. We describe a new type of attack, Adversarial Item Promotion (AIP), that strikes directly at the core of Top-N recommenders: the ranking mechanism itself. Existing work on adversarial images in recommender systems investigates the implications of conventional attacks, which target deep learning classifiers. In contrast, our AIP attacks are embedding attacks that seek to push features representations in a way that fools the ranker (not a classifier) and directly leads to item promotion. We introduce three AIP attacks insider attack, expert attack, and semantic attack, which are defined with respect to three successively more realistic attack models. Our experiments evaluate the danger of these attacks when mounted against three representative visually-aware recommender algorithms in a framework that uses images to address cold start. We also evaluate potential defenses, including adversarial training and find that common, currently-existing, techniques do not eliminate the danger of AIP attacks. In sum, we show that using images to address cold start opens recommender systems to potential threats with clear practical implications.",8

How to effectively detect Android malware under various adversarial example attacks becomes an essential but very challenging issue. Existing adversarial example defense mechanisms usually rely heavily on the instances or the knowledge of adversarial examples, and thus their usability and effectiveness are significantly limited because they often cannot resist the unseen-type adversarial examples. In this paper, we propose a novel robust Android malware detection approach that can resist adversarial examples without requiring their instances or knowledge by jointly investigating malware detection and adversarial example defenses. More precisely, our approach employs a new VAE (variational autoencoder) and an MLP (multi-layer perceptron) to detect malware, and combines their detection outcomes to make the final decision. In particular, we share a feature extraction network between the VAE and the MLP to reduce model complexity and design a new loss function to disentangle the features of different classes, hence improving detection performance. Extensive experiments confirm our model’s advantage in accuracy and robustness. Our method outperforms 11 state-of-the-art robust Android malware detection models when resisting 7 kinds of adversarial example attacks.",1

With little to no effort, people can quickly learn how to generate deepfake (DF) videos. While deep learning-based detection methods have been proposed to identify specific types of DFs, their performance suffers for other types of deepfake methods, including real-world deepfakes, on which they are not sufficiently trained. In other words, most of the proposed deep learning-based detection methods lack transferability and generalizability. Beyond detecting a single type of DF from benchmark deepfake datasets, we focus on developing a generalized approach to detect multiple types of DFs, including deepfakes from unknown generation methods such as DeepFake-in-the-Wild (DFW) videos. To better cope with unknown and unseen deepfakes, we introduce a Convolutional LSTM-based Residual Network (CLRNet), which adopts a unique model training strategy and explores spatial as well as the temporal information in a deepfakes. Through extensive experiments, we show that existing defense methods are not ready for real-world deployment. Whereas our defense method (CLRNet) achieves far better generalization when detecting various benchmark deepfake methods (97.57% on average). Furthermore, we evaluate our approach with a high-quality DeepFake-in-the-Wild dataset, collected from the Internet containing numerous videos and having more than 150,000 frames.

Most recently, NMT systems have been found vulnerable to targeted attacks which cause them to produce specific, unsolicited, and even harmful translations. These attacks are usually exploited in a white-box setting, where adversarial inputs causing targeted translations are discovered for a known target system. However, this approach is less viable when the target system is black-box and unknown to the adversary (e.g., secured commercial systems). In this paper, we show that targeted attacks on black-box NMT systems are feasible, based on poisoning a small fraction of their parallel training data. We show that this attack can be realised practically via targeted corruption of web documents crawled to form the system’s training data. We then analyse the effectiveness of the targeted poisoning in two common NMT training scenarios: the from-scratch training and the pre-train & fine-tune paradigm. Our results are alarming: even on the state-of-the-art systems trained with massive parallel data (tens of millions), the attacks are still successful (over 50% success rate) under surprisingly low poisoning budgets (e.g., 0.006%). Lastly, we discuss potential defences to counter such attacks.",1

However, devising the Mixup methods for graph learning is challenging due to the irregularity and connectivity of graph data. In this paper, we propose the Mixup methods for two fundamental tasks in graph learning: node and graph classification. To interpolate the irregular graph topology, we propose the two-branch graph convolution to mix the receptive field subgraphs for the paired nodes. Mixup on different node pairs can interfere with the mixed features for each other due to the connectivity between nodes. To block this interference, we propose the two-stage Mixup framework, which uses each node’s neighbors’ representations before Mixup for graph convolutions. For graph classification, we interpolate complex and diverse graphs in the semantic space. Qualitatively, our Mixup methods enable GNNs to learn more discriminative features and reduce over-fitting. Quantitative results show that our method yields consistent gains in terms of test accuracy and F1-micro scores on standard datasets, for both node and graph classification. Overall, our method effectively regularizes popular graph neural networks for better generalization without increasing their time complexity.",11

However, the large number of rare labels and small amount of training data per rare label offer significant statistical and computational challenges.

Extreme classification has been successfully applied to several real world web-scale applications such as web search, product recommendation, query rewriting, etc. GalaXC identifies two critical deficiencies in leading extreme classification algorithms. First, existing approaches generally assume that documents and labels reside in disjoint sets, even though in several applications, labels and documents cohabit the same space. Second, several approaches, albeit scalable, do not utilize various forms of metadata offered by applications, such as label text and label correlations. To remedy these, GalaXC presents a framework that enables collaborative learning over joint document-label graphs at massive scales, in a way that naturally allows various auxiliary sources of information, including label metadata, to be incorporated. GalaXC also introduces a novel label-wise attention mechanism to meld high-capacity extreme classifiers with its framework. An efficient end-to-end implementation of GalaXC is presented that could be trained on a dataset with 50M labels and 97M training documents in less than 100 hours on 4 × V100 GPUs. This allowed GalaXC to not only scale to applications with several millions of labels, but also be up to 18% more accurate than leading deep extreme classifiers, while being upto 2-50 × faster to train and 10 × faster to predict on benchmark datasets. GalaXC is particularly well-suited to warm-start scenarios where predictions need to be made on data points with partially revealed label sets, and was found to be up to 25% more accurate than extreme classification algorithms specifically designed for warm start settings.

However, multiple studies have shown that ad delivery on such platforms can be skewed by gender or race due to hidden algorithmic optimization by the platforms, even when not requested by the advertisers. Building on prior work measuring skew in ad delivery, we develop a new methodology for black-box auditing of algorithms for discrimination in the delivery of job advertisements. Our first contribution is to identify the distinction between skew in ad delivery due to protected categories such as gender or race, from skew due to differences in qualification among people in the targeted audience. This distinction is important in U.S. law, where ads may be targeted based on qualifications, but not on protected categories. Second, we develop an auditing methodology that distinguishes between skew explainable by differences in qualifications from other factors, such as the ad platform’s optimization for engagement or training its algorithms on biased data. Our method controls for job qualification by comparing ad delivery of two concurrent ads for similar jobs, but for a pair of companies with different de facto gender distributions of employees. We describe the careful statistical tests that establish evidence of non-qualification skew in the results. Third, we apply our proposed methodology to two prominent targeted advertising platforms for job ads: Facebook and LinkedIn. We confirm skew by gender in ad delivery on Facebook, and show that it cannot be justified by differences in qualifications. We fail to find skew in ad delivery on LinkedIn.

Therefore, multi-objective recommendation (MOR) has been widely explored to jointly model different objectives. Pareto efficiency, where no objective can be further improved without hurting others, is viewed as an optimal situation in multi-objective optimization. Recently, Pareto efficiency model has been introduced to MOR, while all existing scalarization methods only have shared objective weights for all instances. To capture users’ objective-level preferences and enhance personalization in Pareto-efficient recommendation, we propose a novel Personalized Approximate Pareto-Efficient Recommendation (PAPERec) framework for multi-objective recommendation. Specifically, we design an approximate Pareto-efficient learning based on scalarization with KKT conditions that closely mimics Pareto efficiency, where users have personalized weights on different objectives. We propose a Pareto-oriented reinforcement learning module to find appropriate personalized objective weights for each user, with the weighted sum of multiple objectives’ gradients considered in reward. In experiments, we conduct extensive offline and online evaluations on a real-world recommendation system. The significant improvements verify the effectiveness of PAPERec in practice. We have deployed PAPERec on WeChat Top Stories, affecting millions of users. The source codes are released in https://github.com/onepunch-cyber/PAPERec.",5

In state-of-the-art research, this is a one-way signal, though, to improve user acceptance. In this paper, we turn the role of explanations around and investigate how they can contribute to enhancing the quality of generated recommendations themselves. We devise a human-in-the-loop framework, called Elixir, where user feedback on explanations is leveraged for pairwise learning of user preferences. Elixir leverages feedback on pairs of recommendations and explanations to learn user-specific latent preference vectors, overcoming sparseness by label propagation with item-similarity-based neighborhoods. Our framework is instantiated using generalized graph recommendation via Random Walk with Restart. Insightful experiments with a real user study show significant improvements in movie and book recommendations over item-level feedback.",1

The state-of-the-art methods rely on unidirectional distillation transferring the knowledge only from the teacher to the student, with an underlying assumption that the teacher is always superior to the student. However, we demonstrate that the student performs better than the teacher on a significant proportion of the test set, especially for RS. Based on this observation, we propose Bidirectional Distillation (BD) framework whereby both the teacher and the student collaboratively improve with each other. Specifically, each model is trained with the distillation loss that makes to follow the other’s prediction along with its original loss function. For effective bidirectional distillation, we propose rank discrepancy-aware sampling scheme to distill only the informative knowledge that can fully enhance each other. The proposed scheme is designed to effectively cope with a large performance gap between the teacher and the student. Trained in the bidirectional way, it turns out that both the teacher and the student are significantly improved compared to when being trained separately. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our proposed framework consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors. We also provide analyses for an in-depth understanding of BD and ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of each proposed component.",5

It is increasingly obvious, however, that content providers have a critical influence on user satisfaction through content creation, largely determining the content pool available for recommendation. A natural question thus arises: can we design recommenders taking into account the long-term utility of both users and content providers? By doing so, we hope to sustain more content providers and a more diverse content pool for long-term user satisfaction. Understanding the full impact of recommendations on both user and content provider groups is challenging. This paper aims to serve as a research investigation of one approach toward building a content provider aware recommender, and evaluating its impact in a simulated setup.",0

How to enhance the robustness of network alignment against adversarial attacks remains an open research problem. In this paper, we propose a robust network alignment solution, RNA, for offering preemptive protection of existing network alignment algorithms, enhanced with the guidance of effective adversarial attacks. First, we analyze how popular iterative gradient-based adversarial attack techniques suffer from gradient vanishing issues and show a fake sense of attack effectiveness. Based on dynamical isometry theory, an attack signal scaling (ASS) method with established upper bound of feasible signal scaling is introduced to alleviate the gradient vanishing issues for effective adversarial attacks while maintaining the decision boundary of network alignment. Second, we develop an adversarial perturbation elimination (APE) model to neutralize adversarial nodes in vulnerable space to adversarial-free nodes in safe area, by integrating Dirac delta approximation (DDA) techniques and the LSTM models. Our proposed APE method is able to provide proactive protection to existing network alignment algorithms against adversarial attacks. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the existence of an optimal distribution for the APE model to reach a lower bound. Last but not least, extensive evaluation on real datasets presents that RNA is able to offer the preemptive protection to trained network alignment methods against three popular adversarial attack models.",5

The vast majority of existing works focus on how to best utilize the topology and attribute information of the input networks as well as the anchor links when available. Nonetheless, it has not been well studied on how to boost the alignment performance through actively obtaining high-quality and informative anchor links, with a few exceptions. The sparse literature on active network alignment introduces the human in the loop to label some seed node correspondence (i.e., anchor links), which are informative from the perspective of querying the most uncertain node given few potential matchings. However, the direct influence of the intrinsic network attribute information on the alignment results has largely remained unknown. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and propose an active network alignment method (Attent) to identify the best nodes to query. The key idea of the proposed method is to leverage effective and efficient influence functions defined over the alignment solution to evaluate the goodness of the candidate nodes for query. Our proposed query strategy bears three distinct advantages, including (1) effectiveness, being able to accurately quantify the influence of the candidate nodes on the alignment results; (2) efficiency, scaling linearly with 15 − 17 × speed-up over the straight-forward implementation without any quality loss; (3) generality, consistently improving alignment performance of a variety of network alignment algorithms.",2

Network alignment, which aims to find the node correspondence across different networks, plays a fundamental role for many data mining tasks. Most of the existing methods can be divided into two categories: (1) consistency optimization based methods, which often explicitly assume the alignment to be consistent in terms of neighborhood topology and attribute across networks, and (2) network embedding based methods which learn low-dimensional node embedding vectors to infer alignment. In this paper, by analyzing representative methods of these two categories, we show that (1) the consistency optimization based methods are essentially specific random walk propagations from anchor links that might be too restrictive; (2) the embedding based methods no longer explicitly assume alignment consistency but inevitably suffer from the space disparity issue. To overcome these two limitations, we bridge these methods and propose a novel family of network alignment algorithms BRIGHT to handle both plain and attributed networks. Specifically, it constructs a space by random walk with restart (RWR) whose bases are one-hot encoding vectors of anchor nodes, followed by a shared linear layer. Our experiments on real-world networks show that the proposed family of algorithms BRIGHT outperform the state-of-the-arts for both plain and attributed network alignment tasks.",4

In this paper, we propose very efficient algorithms, based on a distance oracle, for computing approximate shortest paths and alternate paths in road networks. Specifically, we adopt a distance oracle construction that exploits the existence of small separators in such networks. In other words, the existence of a small cut in a graph admits a partitioning of the graph into balanced components with a small number of inter-component edges. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm by using it to find near optimal shortest paths and show that it also has the desired properties of well-studied goal-oriented path search algorithms such as ALT [12]. We further demonstrate the use of our distance oracle to produce multiple alternative routes in addition to the shortest path. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our method, while exploring few edges, produces high quality alternates with respect to metrics such as optimality-loss and diversity of paths.",1

The weighted version of this problem, where each vertex is assigned a nonnegative weight, also receives a lot of attention due to its potential applications in many areas. However, many nice properties and fast algorithms for the unweighted version can not be extended to the weighted version. In this paper, we study the structural properties of this problem, giving some sufficient conditions for a vertex being or not being in a maximum weighted independent set. These properties provide a suite of reduction rules that includes and generalizes almost all frequently used reduction rules for this problem. These rules can efficiently find partial solutions and greatly reduce the instances, especially for sparse graphs. Based on them, we also propose a simple exact yet practical algorithm. To demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm, we compare it with state-of-the-art algorithms on several well-known datasets from the real world. The experimental results reveal that our exact algorithm is not only faster than existing algorithms but also can exactly solve more hard instances with 1,000 seconds. For remaining infeasible instances, our reduction rules can also improve existing heuristic algorithms by producing higher-quality solutions using less time.",1

We use data from a field experiment where reserve prices were randomized on Google’s advertising exchange (AdX). We find that, contrary to the predictions of classical auction theory, a significant set of buyers lowers their bids when reserve prices go up. We show that this behavior can be explained if we assume buyers have constraints on their minimum return on investment (ROI). We proceed to design auctions for ROI-constrained buyers. We show that optimal auctions for symmetric ROI-constrained buyers are either second-price auctions with reduced reserve prices or subsidized second-price auctions. For asymmetric buyers, the optimal auction involves a modification of virtual values. Going back to the data, we show that using ROI-aware optimal auctions can lead to large revenue gains and large welfare gains for buyers.",15

Sponsored search auctions are a billion dollar industry and the main source of revenue of several tech giants. A critical problem in optimizing such marketplaces is understanding how bidders will react to changes in the auction design. We propose the use of no-regret-based econometrics for bid prediction, modeling players as no-regret learners with respect to a utility function, unknown to the analyst. We propose econometric approaches to simultaneously learn the parameters of a player’s utility and her learning rule, and apply these methods to a real-world dataset from the BingAds sponsored search auction marketplace. We show that the no-regret econometric methods perform comparably to state-of-the-art time-series machine-learning methods when there is no co-variate shift, but significantly outperform machine-learning methods when there is a co-variate shift between the training and test periods. This portrays the importance of using structural econometric approaches for predicting how players will respond to changes in the market. Moreover, we show that among structural econometric methods, approaches based on no-regret learning outperform more traditional, equilibrium-based, econometric methods that assume that players continuously best respond to competition. Finally, we demonstrate how the prediction performance of the no-regret learning algorithms can be further improved by considering bidders who optimize a utility function with a visibility bias component.",6

Publicly available knowledge graphs like Wikidata or DBpedia are, however, far from being complete. In this paper, we explore how information extracted from similar entities that co-occur in structures like tables or lists can help to increase the coverage of such knowledge graphs. In contrast to existing approaches, we do not focus on relationships within a listing (e.g., between two entities in a table row) but on the relationship between a listing’s subject entities and the context of the listing. To that end, we propose a descriptive rule mining approach that uses distant supervision to derive rules for these relationships based on a listing’s context. Extracted from a suitable data corpus, the rules can be used to extend a knowledge graph with novel entities and assertions. In our experiments we demonstrate that the approach is able to extract up to 3M novel entities and 30M additional assertions from listings in Wikipedia. We find that the extracted information is of high quality and thus suitable to extend Wikipedia-based knowledge graphs like DBpedia, YAGO, and CaLiGraph. For the case of DBpedia, this would result in an increase of covered entities by roughly 50%.",2

Relational Web tables are a critical component containing additional entities and attributes of rich and diverse knowledge.

Existing work linearize table cells and heavily rely on modifying deep language models such as BERT which only captures related cells information in the same table. In this work, we propose a novel relational table representation learning approach considering both the intra- and inter-table contextual information. On one hand, the proposed Table Convolutional Network model employs the attention mechanism to adaptively focus on the most informative intra-table cells of the same row or column; and, on the other hand, it aggregates inter-table contextual information from various types of implicit connections between cells across different tables. Specifically, we propose three novel aggregation modules for (i) cells of the same value, (ii) cells of the same schema position, and (iii) cells linked to the same page topic.

Our method includes a new approach to aligning quantity columns to entity columns. Prior works assumed a single subject-column per table, whereas our approach is geared for complex tables and leverages external corpora as evidence.

Recently, tensor decomposition methods have been introduced into N-ary relational data and become state-of-the-art on embedding learning. However, the performance of existing tensor decomposition methods is not as good as desired. First, they suffer from the data-sparsity issue since they can only learn from the N-ary relational data with a specific arity, i.e., parts of common N-ary relational data. Besides, they are neither effective nor efficient enough to be trained due to the over-parameterization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method, i.e., S2S, for effectively and efficiently learning from the N-ary relational data. Specifically, we propose a new tensor decomposition framework, which allows embedding sharing to learn from facts with mixed arity. Since the core tensors may still suffer from the over-parameterization, we propose to reduce parameters by sparsifying the core tensors while retaining their expressive power using neural architecture search (NAS) techniques, which can search for data-dependent architectures. As a result, the proposed S2S not only guarantees to be expressive but also efficiently learns from mixed arity. Finally, empirical results have demonstrated that S2S is efficient to train and achieves state-of-the-art performance. 1",2
