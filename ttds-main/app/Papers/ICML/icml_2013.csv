Each observation results from evaluating an imperfect classifier of a chosen cost and accuracy on an interval of chosen length and position. Within a Bayesian framework, we study the problem of minimizing an objective that combines the entropy of the posterior distribution with the cost of the questions asked. In this problem, we show that the one-step lookahead policy is Bayes-optimal for any arbitrary time horizon. Moreover, this one-step lookahead policy is easy to compute and implement. We then use this policy in the context of localizing mitochondria in electron microscope images, and experimentally show that significant speed ups in acquisition can be gained, while maintaining near equal image quality at target locations, when compared to current policies."

We propose Domain-Invariant Component Analysis (DICA), a kernel-based optimization algorithm that learns an invariant transformation by minimizing the dissimilarity across domains, whilst preserving the functional relationship between input and output variables. A learning-theoretic analysis shows that reducing dissimilarity improves the expected generalization ability of classifiers on new domains, motivating the proposed algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DICA successfully learns invariant features and improves classifier performance in practice."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/boots13.pdf,A Spectral Learning Approach to Range-Only SLAM,"Byron Boots, Geoff Gordon","We present a novel spectral learning algorithm for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from range data with known correspondences. This algorithm is an instance of a general spectral system identification framework, from which it inherits several desirable properties, including statistical consistency and no local optima. Compared with popular batch optimization or multiple-hypothesis tracking (MHT) methods for range-only SLAM, our spectral approach offers guaranteed low computational requirements and good tracking performance. Compared with MHT and with popular extended Kalman filter (EKF) or extended information filter (EIF) approaches, our approach does not need to linearize a transition or measurement model. We provide a theoretical analysis of our method, including finite-sample error bounds. Finally, we demonstrate on a real-world robotic SLAM problem that our algorithm is not only theoretically justified, but works well in practice: in a comparison of multiple methods, the lowest errors come from a combination of our algorithm with batch optimization, but our method alone produces nearly as good a result at far lower computational cost."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/kumar13a.pdf,Near-Optimal Bounds for Cross-Validation via Loss Stability,"Ravi Kumar, Daniel Lokshtanov, Sergei Vassilvitskii, Andrea Vattani",Multi-fold cross-validation is an established practice to estimate the error rate of a learning algorithm. Quantifying the variance reduction gains due to cross-validation has been challenging due to the inherent correlations introduced by the folds. In this work we introduce a new and weak measure of stability called \emphloss stability and relate the cross-validation performance to loss stability; we also establish that this relationship is near-optimal. Our work thus quantitatively improves the current best bounds on cross-validation.
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/mehta13.pdf,Sparsity-Based Generalization Bounds for Predictive Sparse Coding,"Nishant Mehta, Alexander Gray","The goal of predictive sparse coding is to learn a representation of examples as sparse linear combinations of elements from a dictionary, such that a learned hypothesis linear in the new representation performs well on a predictive task. Predictive sparse coding has demonstrated impressive performance on a variety of supervised tasks, but its generalization properties have not been studied. We establish the first generalization error bounds for predictive sparse coding, in the overcomplete setting, where the number of features k exceeds the original dimensionality d. The learning bound decays as (sqrt(d k/m)) with respect to d, k, and the size m of the training sample. It depends intimately on stability properties of the learned sparse encoder, as measured on the training sample. Consequently, we also present a fundamental stability result for the LASSO, a result that characterizes the stability of the sparse codes with respect to dictionary perturbations."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/zhang13.pdf,Sparse Uncorrelated Linear Discriminant Analysis,"Xiaowei Zhang, Delin Chu","In this paper, we develop a novel approach for sparse uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis (ULDA). Our proposal is based on characterization of all solutions of the generalized ULDA. We incorporate sparsity into the ULDA transformation by seeking the solution with minimum \ell_1-norm from all minimum dimension solutions of the generalized ULDA. The problem is then formulated as a \ell_1-minimization problem and is solved by accelerated linearized Bregman method. Experiments on high-dimensional gene expression data demonstrate that our approach not only computes extremely sparse solutions but also performs well in classification. Experimental results also show that our approach can help for data visualization in low-dimensional space."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/lacoste-julien13.pdf,Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe Optimization for Structural SVMs,"Simon Lacoste-Julien, Martin Jaggi, Mark Schmidt, Patrick Pletscher","We propose a randomized block-coordinate variant of the classic Frank-Wolfe algorithm for convex optimization with block-separable constraints. Despite its lower iteration cost, we show that it achieves a similar convergence rate in duality gap as the full Frank-Wolfe algorithm. We also show that, when applied to the dual structural support vector machine (SVM) objective, this yields an online algorithm that has the same low iteration complexity as primal stochastic subgradient methods. However, unlike stochastic subgradient methods, the block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm allows us to compute the optimal step-size and yields a computable duality gap guarantee. Our experiments indicate that this simple algorithm outperforms competing structural SVM solvers."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/hennig13.pdf,Fast Probabilistic Optimization from Noisy Gradients,Philipp Hennig,"Stochastic gradient descent remains popular in large-scale machine learning, on account of its very low computational cost and robustness to noise. However, gradient descent is only linearly efficient and not transformation invariant. Scaling by a local measure can substantially improve its performance. One natural choice of such a scale is the Hessian of the objective function: Were it available, it would turn linearly efficient gradient descent into the quadratically efficient Newton-Raphson optimization. Existing covariant methods, though, are either super-linearly expensive or do not address noise. Generalising recent results, this paper constructs a nonparametric Bayesian quasi-Newton algorithm that learns gradient and Hessian from noisy evaluations of the gradient. Importantly, the resulting algorithm, like stochastic gradient descent, has cost linear in the number of input dimensions."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/shamir13.pdf,Stochastic Gradient Descent for Non-smooth Optimization: Convergence Results and Optimal Averaging Schemes,"Ohad Shamir, Tong Zhang","Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is one of the simplest and most popular stochastic optimization methods. While it has already been theoretically studied for decades, the classical analysis usually required non-trivial smoothness assumptions, which do not apply to many modern applications of SGD with non-smooth objective functions such as support vector machines. In this paper, we investigate the performance of SGD \emphwithout such smoothness assumptions, as well as a running average scheme to convert the SGD iterates to a solution with optimal optimization accuracy. In this framework, we prove that after T rounds, the suboptimality of the \emphlast SGD iterate scales as O(\log(T)/\sqrtT) for non-smooth convex objective functions, and O(\log(T)/T) in the non-smooth strongly convex case. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first bounds of this kind, and almost match the minimax-optimal rates obtainable by appropriate averaging schemes. We also propose a new and simple averaging scheme, which not only attains optimal rates, but can also be easily computed on-the-fly (in contrast, the suffix averaging scheme proposed in \citetRakhShaSri12arxiv is not as simple to implement). Finally, we provide some experimental illustrations."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/ouyang13.pdf,Stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers,"Hua Ouyang, Niao He, Long Tran, Alexander Gray","The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has received lots of attention recently due to the tremendous demand from large-scale and data-distributed machine learning applications. In this paper, we present a stochastic setting for optimization problems with non-smooth composite objective functions. To solve this problem, we propose a stochastic ADMM algorithm. Our algorithm applies to a more general class of convex and nonsmooth objective functions, beyond the smooth and separable least squares loss used in lasso. We also demonstrate the rates of convergence for our algorithm under various structural assumptions of the stochastic function: O(1/\sqrtt) for convex functions and O(\log t/t) for strongly convex functions. Compared to previous literature, we establish the convergence rate of ADMM for convex problems in terms of both the objective value and the feasibility violation. A novel application named Graph-Guided SVM is proposed to demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/wang13.pdf,Noisy Sparse Subspace Clustering,"Yu-Xiang Wang, Huan Xu","This paper considers the problem of subspace clustering under noise. Specifically, we study the behavior of Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) when either adversarial or random noise is added to the unlabelled input data points, which are assumed to lie in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. We show that a modified version of SSC is \emphprovably effective in correctly identifying the underlying subspaces, even with noisy data. This extends theoretical guarantee of this algorithm to the practical setting and provides justification to the success of SSC in a class of real applications."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/williamson13.pdf,Parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Nonparametric Mixture Models,"Sinead Williamson, Avinava Dubey, Eric Xing","Nonparametric mixture models based on the Dirichlet process are an elegant alternative to finite models when the number of underlying components is unknown, but inference in such models can be slow. Existing attempts to parallelize inference in such models have relied on introducing approximations, which can lead to inaccuracies in the posterior estimate. In this paper, we describe auxiliary variable representations for the Dirichlet process and the hierarchical Dirichlet process that allow us to perform MCMC using the correct equilibrium distribution, in a distributed manner. We show that our approach allows scalable inference without the deterioration in estimate quality that accompanies existing methods."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/giguere13.pdf,Risk Bounds and Learning Algorithms for the Regression Approach to Structured Output Prediction,"Sébastien Giguère, François Laviolette, Mario Marchand, Khadidja Sylla",We provide rigorous guarantees for the regression approach to structured output prediction. We show that the quadratic regression loss is a convex surrogate of the prediction loss when the output kernel satisfies some condition with respect to the prediction loss. We provide two upper bounds of the prediction risk that depend on the empirical quadratic risk of the predictor. The minimizer of the first bound is the predictor proposed by Cortes et al. (2007) while the minimizer of the second bound is a predictor that has never been proposed so far. Both predictors are compared on practical tasks.
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/bergstra13.pdf,Making a Science of Model Search: Hyperparameter Optimization in Hundreds of Dimensions for Vision Architectures,"James Bergstra, Daniel Yamins, David Cox","Many computer vision algorithms depend on configuration settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the algorithm for a particular data set. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical to realizing a method’s full potential. Compounding matters, these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that are hard to quantify or describe. Since the performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the algorithm and the details of its tuning, it is sometimes difficult to know whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned. In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyperparameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools that replace hand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g. classification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from hyperparameters that govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even which processing steps are included. A hyperparameter optimization algorithm transforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric. Our approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision problems: a face-matching verification task (LFW), a face identification task (PubFig83) and an object recognition task (CIFAR-10), using a single broad class of feed-forward vision architectures."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/zhu13.pdf,Gibbs Max-Margin Topic Models with Fast Sampling Algorithms,"Jun Zhu, Ning Chen, Hugh Perkins, Bo Zhang","Existing max-margin supervised topic models rely on an iterative procedure to solve multiple latent SVM subproblems with additional mean-field assumptions on the desired posterior distributions. This paper presents Gibbs max-margin supervised topic models by minimizing an expected margin loss, an upper bound of the existing margin loss derived from an expected prediction rule. By introducing augmented variables, we develop simple and fast Gibbs sampling algorithms with no restricting assumptions and no need to solve SVM subproblems for both classification and regression. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements on time efficiency. The classification performance is also significantly improved over competitors."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/xu13.pdf,Cost-Sensitive Tree of Classifiers,"Zhixiang Xu, Matt Kusner, Kilian Weinberger, Minmin Chen","Recently, machine learning algorithms have successfully entered large-scale real-world industrial applications (e.g. search engines and email spam filters). Here, the CPU cost during test-time must be budgeted and accounted for. In this paper, we address the challenge of balancing test-time cost and the classifier accuracy in a principled fashion. The test-time cost of a classifier is often dominated by the computation required for feature extraction-which can vary drastically across features. We incorporate this extraction time by constructing a tree of classifiers, through which test inputs traverse along individual paths. Each path extracts different features and is optimized for a specific sub-partition of the input space. By only computing features for inputs that benefit from them the most, our cost-sensitive tree of classifiers can match the high accuracies of the current state-of-the-art at a small fraction of the computational cost."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/li13a.pdf,Learning Hash Functions Using Column Generation,"Xi Li, Guosheng Lin, Chunhua Shen, Anton Hengel, Anthony Dick","Fast nearest neighbor searching is becoming an increasingly important tool in solving many large-scale problems. Recently a number of approaches to learning data-dependent hash functions have been developed. In this work, we propose a column generation based method for learning data-dependent hash functions on the basis of proximity comparison information. Given a set of triplets that encode the pairwise proximity comparison information, our method learns hash functions that preserve the relative comparison relationships in the data as well as possible within the large-margin learning framework. The learning procedure is implemented using column generation and hence is named CGHash. At each iteration of the column generation procedure, the best hash function is selected. Unlike most other hashing methods, our method generalizes to new data points naturally; and has a training objective which is convex, thus ensuring that the global optimum can be identified. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method learns compact binary codes and that its retrieval performance compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods when tested on a few benchmark datasets."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/chen13a.pdf,Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit: General Framework and Applications,"Wei Chen, Yajun Wang, Yang Yuan","We define a general framework for a large class of combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problems, where simple arms with unknown istributions form \em super arms. In each round, a super arm is played and the outcomes of its related simple arms are observed, which helps the selection of super arms in future rounds. The reward of the super arm depends on the outcomes of played arms, and it only needs to satisfy two mild assumptions, which allow a large class of nonlinear reward instances. We assume the availability of an (α,β)-approximation oracle that takes the means of the distributions of arms and outputs a super arm that with probability βgenerates an αfraction of the optimal expected reward. The objective of a CMAB algorithm is to minimize \em (α,β)-approximation regret, which is the difference in total expected reward between the αβfraction of expected reward when always playing the optimal super arm, and the expected reward of playing super arms according to the algorithm. We provide CUCB algorithm that achieves O(\log n) regret, where n is the number of rounds played, and we further provide distribution-independent bounds for a large class of reward functions. Our regret analysis is tight in that it matches the bound for classical MAB problem up to a constant factor, and it significantly improves the regret bound in a recent paper on combinatorial bandits with linear rewards. We apply our CMAB framework to two new applications, probabilistic maximum coverage (PMC) for online advertising and social influence maximization for viral marketing, both having nonlinear reward structures."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/chen13b.pdf,Near-optimal Batch Mode Active Learning and Adaptive Submodular Optimization,"Yuxin Chen, Andreas Krause","Active learning can lead to a dramatic reduction in labeling effort. However, in many practical implementations (such as crowdsourcing, surveys, high-throughput experimental design), it is preferable to query labels for batches of examples to be labelled in parallel. While several heuristics have been proposed for batch-mode active learning, little is known about their theoretical performance. We consider batch mode active learning and more general information-parallel stochastic optimization problems that exhibit adaptive submodularity, a natural diminishing returns condition. We prove that for such problems, a simple greedy strategy is competitive with the optimal batch-mode policy. In some cases, surprisingly, the use of batches incurs competitively low cost, even when compared to a fully sequential strategy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on batch-mode active learning tasks, where it outperforms the state of the art, as well as the novel problem of multi-stage influence maximization in social networks."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/do13.pdf,Convex formulations of radius-margin based Support Vector Machines,"Huyen Do, Alexandros Kalousis","We consider Support Vector Machines (SVMs) learned together with linear transformations of the feature spaces on which they are applied. Under this scenario the radius of the smallest data enclosing sphere is no longer fixed. Therefore optimizing the SVM error bound by considering both the radius and the margin has the potential to deliver a tighter error bound. In this paper we present two novel algorithms: R-SVM_μ^+—a SVM radius-margin based feature selection algorithm, and R-SVM^+ — a metric learning-based SVM. We derive our algorithms by exploiting a new tighter approximation of the radius and a metric learning interpretation of SVM. Both optimize directly the radius-margin error bound using linear transformations. Unlike almost all existing radius-margin based SVM algorithms which are either non-convex or combinatorial, our algorithms are standard quadratic convex optimization problems with linear or quadratic constraints. We perform a number of experiments on benchmark datasets. R-SVM_μ^+ exhibits excellent feature selection performance compared to the state-of-the-art feature selection methods, such as L_1-norm and elastic-net based methods. R-SVM^+ achieves a significantly better classification performance compared to SVM and its other state-of-the-art variants. From the results it is clear that the incorporation of the radius, as a means to control the data spread, in the cost function has strong beneficial effects."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/hamilton13.pdf,Modelling Sparse Dynamical Systems with Compressed Predictive State Representations,"William L. Hamilton, Mahdi Milani Fard, Joelle Pineau","Efficiently learning accurate models of dynamical systems is of central importance for developing rational agents that can succeed in a wide range of challenging domains. The difficulty of this learning problem is particularly acute in settings with large observation spaces and partial observability. We present a new algorithm, called Compressed Predictive State Representation (CPSR), for learning models of high-dimensional partially observable uncontrolled dynamical systems from small sample sets. The algorithm, which extends previous work on Predictive State Representations, exploits a particular sparse structure present in many domains. This sparse structure is used to compress information during learning, allowing for an increase in both the efficiency and predictive power. The compression technique also relieves the burden of domain specific feature selection and allows for domains with extremely large discrete observation spaces to be efficiently modelled. We present empirical results showing that the algorithm is able to build accurate models more efficiently than its uncompressed counterparts, and provide theoretical results on the accuracy of the learned compressed model."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/menon13.pdf,A Machine Learning Framework for Programming by Example,"Aditya Menon, Omer Tamuz, Sumit Gulwani, Butler Lampson, Adam Kalai","Learning programs is a timely and interesting challenge. In Programming by Example (PBE), a system attempts to infer a program from input and output examples alone, by searching for a composition of some set of base functions. We show how machine learning can be used to speed up this seemingly hopeless search problem, by learning weights that relate textual features describing the provided input-output examples to plausible sub-components of a program. This generic learning framework lets us address problems beyond the scope of earlier PBE systems. Experiments on a prototype implementation show that learning improves search and ranking on a variety of text processing tasks found on help forums."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/girshick13.pdf,Discriminatively Activated Sparselets,"Ross Girshick, Hyun Oh Song, Trevor Darrell","Shared representations are highly appealing due to their potential for gains in computational and statistical efficiency. Compressing a shared representation leads to greater computational savings, but at the same time can severely decrease performance on a target task. Recently, sparselets (Song et al., 2012) were introduced as a new shared intermediate representation for multiclass object detection with deformable part models (Felzenszwalb et al., 2010a), showing significant speedup factors, but with a large decrease in task performance. In this paper we describe a new training framework that learns which sparselets to activate in order to optimize a discriminative objective, leading to larger speedup factors with no decrease in task performance. We first reformulate sparselets in a general structured output prediction framework, then analyze when sparselets lead to computational efficiency gains, and lastly show experimental results on object detection and image classification tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that discriminative activation substantially outperforms the previous reconstructive approach which, together with our structured output prediction formulation, make sparselets broadly applicable and significantly more effective."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/pele13.pdf,The Pairwise Piecewise-Linear Embedding for Efficient Non-Linear Classification,"Ofir Pele, Ben Taskar, Amir Globerson, Michael Werman","Linear classiffers are much faster to learn and test than non-linear ones. On the other hand, non-linear kernels offer improved performance, albeit at the increased cost of training kernel classiffers. To use non-linear mappings with efficient linear learning algorithms, explicit embeddings that approximate popular kernels have recently been proposed. However, the embedding process itself is often costly and the results are usually less accurate than kernel methods. In this work we propose a non-linear feature map that is both very efficient, but at the same time highly expressive. The method is based on discretization and interpolation of individual features values and feature pairs. The discretization allows us to model different regions of the feature space separately, while the interpolation preserves the original continuous values. Using this embedding is strictly more general than a linear model and as efficient as the second-order polynomial explicit feature map. An extensive empirical evaluation shows that our method consistently signiffcantly outperforms other methods, including a wide range of kernels. This is in contrast to other proposed embeddings that were faster than kernel methods, but with lower accuracy."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/li13b.pdf,Fixed-Point Model For Structured Labeling,"Quannan Li, Jingdong Wang, David Wipf, Zhuowen Tu","In this paper, we propose a simple but effective solution to the structured labeling problem: a fixed-point model. Recently, layered models with sequential classifiers/regressors have gained an increasing amount of interests for structural prediction. Here, we design an algorithm with a new perspective on layered models; we aim to find a fixed-point function with the structured labels being both the output and the input. Our approach alleviates the burden in learning multiple/different classifiers in different layers. We devise a training strategy for our method and provide justifications for the fixed-point function to be a contraction mapping. The learned function captures rich contextual information and is easy to train and test. On several widely used benchmark datasets, the proposed method observes significant improvement in both performance and efficiency over many state-of-the-art algorithms."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/gong13.pdf,Connecting the Dots with Landmarks: Discriminatively Learning Domain-Invariant Features for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Boqing Gong, Kristen Grauman, Fei Sha","Learning domain-invariant features is of vital importance to unsupervised domain adaptation, where classifiers trained on the source domain need to be adapted to a different target domain for which no labeled examples are available. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning such features. The central idea is to exploit the existence of landmarks, which are a subset of labeled data instances in the source domain that are distributed most similarly to the target domain. Our approach automatically discovers the landmarks and use them to bridge the source to the target by constructing provably easier auxiliary domain adaptation tasks. The solutions of those auxiliary tasks form the basis to compose invariant features for the original task. We show how this composition can be optimized discriminatively without requiring labels from the target domain. We validate the method on standard benchmark datasets for visual object recognition and sentiment analysis of text. Empirical results show the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/kumar13b.pdf,Fast Conical Hull Algorithms for Near-separable Non-negative Matrix Factorization,"Abhishek Kumar, Vikas Sindhwani, Prabhanjan Kambadur","The separability assumption (Arora et al., 2012; Donoho & Stodden, 2003) turns non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) into a tractable problem. Recently, a new class of provably-correct NMF algorithms have emerged under this assumption. In this paper, we reformulate the separable NMF problem as that of finding the extreme rays of the conical hull of a finite set of vectors. From this geometric perspective, we derive new separable NMF algorithms that are highly scalable and empirically noise robust, and have several favorable properties in relation to existing methods. A parallel implementation of our algorithm scales excellently on shared and distributed-memory machines."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/han13.pdf,Principal Component Analysis on non-Gaussian Dependent Data,"Fang Han, Han Liu","In this paper, we analyze the performance of a semiparametric principal component analysis named Copula Component Analysis (COCA) (Han & Liu, 2012) when the data are dependent. The semiparametric model assumes that, after unspecified marginally monotone transformations, the distributions are multivariate Gaussian. We study the scenario where the observations are drawn from non-i.i.d. processes (m-dependency or a more general ϕ-mixing case). We show that COCA can allow weak dependence. In particular, we provide the generalization bounds of convergence for both support recovery and parameter estimation of COCA for the dependent data. We provide explicit sufficient conditions on the degree of dependence, under which the parametric rate can be maintained. To our knowledge, this is the first work analyzing the theoretical performance of PCA for the dependent data in high dimensional settings. Our results strictly generalize the analysis in Han & Liu (2012) and the techniques we used have the separate interest for analyzing a variety of other multivariate statistical methods."

Identifiability and efficient recovery from low-order observable moments are established under a novel graphical constraint. The constraint concerns the expansion properties of the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) between observed and unobserved variables in the network, and it is satisfied by many natural families of DAGs that include multi-level DAGs, DAGs with effective depth one, as well as certain families of polytrees."

Our proposed solution relies on a new algorithm based on successive rejects of the seemingly bad arms, and successive accepts of the good ones. This algorithmic contribution allows to tackle other multiple identifications settings that were previously out of reach. In particular we show that this idea of successive accepts and rejects applies to the multi-bandit best arm identification problem."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/cotter13.pdf,Learning Optimally Sparse Support Vector Machines,"Andrew Cotter, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Nati Srebro","We show how to train SVMs with an optimal guarantee on the number of support vectors (up to constants), and with sample complexity and training runtime bounds matching the best known for kernel SVM optimization (i.e. without any additional asymptotic cost beyond standard SVM training). Our method is simple to implement and works well in practice."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/heaukulani13.pdf,Dynamic Probabilistic Models for Latent Feature Propagation in Social Networks,"Creighton Heaukulani, Zoubin Ghahramani","Current Bayesian models for dynamic social network data have focused on modelling the influence of evolving unobserved structure on observed social interactions. However, an understanding of how observed social relationships from the past affect future unobserved structure in the network has been neglected. In this paper, we introduce a new probabilistic model for capturing this phenomenon, which we call latent feature propagation, in social networks. We demonstrate our model’s capability for inferring such latent structure in varying types of social network datasets, and experimental studies show this structure achieves higher predictive performance on link prediction and forecasting tasks."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/xiang13.pdf,Efficient Sparse Group Feature Selection via Nonconvex Optimization,"Shuo Xiang, Xiaoshen Tong, Jieping Ye","Sparse feature selection has been demonstrated to be effective in handling high-dimensional data. While promising, most of the existing works use convex methods, which may be suboptimal in terms of the accuracy of feature selection and parameter estimation. In this paper, we expand a nonconvex paradigm to sparse group feature selection, which is motivated by applications that require identifying the underlying group structure and performing feature selection simultaneously. The main contributions of this article are twofold: (1) computationally, we introduce a nonconvex sparse group feature selection model and present an efficient optimization algorithm, of which the key step is a projection with two coupled constraints; (2) statistically, we show that the proposed model can reconstruct the oracle estimator. Therefore, consistent feature selection and parameter estimation can be achieved. Numerical results on synthetic and real-world data suggest that the proposed nonconvex method compares favorably against its competitors, thus achieving desired goal of delivering high performance."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/xiao13.pdf,Domain Adaptation for Sequence Labeling Tasks with a Probabilistic Language Adaptation Model,"Min Xiao, Yuhong Guo","In this paper, we propose to address the problem of domain adaptation for sequence labeling tasks via distributed representation learning by using a log-bilinear language adaptation model. The proposed neural probabilistic language model simultaneously models two different but related data distributions in the source and target domains based on induced distributed representations, which encode both generalizable and domain-specific latent features. We then use the learned dense real-valued representation as augmenting features for natural language processing systems. We empirically evaluate the proposed learning technique on WSJ and MEDLINE domains with POS tagging systems, and on WSJ and Brown corpora with syntactic chunking and name entity recognition systems. Our primary results show that the proposed domain adaptation method outperforms a number comparison methods for cross domain sequence labeling tasks."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/chen13c.pdf,Maximum Variance Correction with Application to A* Search,"Wenlin Chen, Kilian Weinberger, Yixin Chen","In this paper we introduce Maximum Variance Correction (MVC), which finds large-scale feasible solutions to Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU) by post-processing embeddings from any manifold learning algorithm. It increases the scale of MVU embeddings by several orders of magnitude and is naturally parallel. This unprecedented scalability opens up new avenues of applications for manifold learning, in particular the use of MVU embeddings as effective heuristics to speed-up A* search (Rayner et al. 2011). We demonstrate that MVC embeddings lead to un-matched reductions in search time across several non-trivial A* benchmark search problems and bridge the gap between the manifold learning literature and one of its most promising high impact applications."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/wong13.pdf,Adaptive Sparsity in Gaussian Graphical Models,"Eleanor Wong, Suyash Awate, P. Thomas Fletcher","An effective approach to structure learning and parameter estimation for Gaussian graphical models is to impose a sparsity prior, such as a Laplace prior, on the entries of the precision matrix. Such an approach involves a hyperparameter that must be tuned to control the amount of sparsity. In this paper, we introduce a parameter-free method for estimating a precision matrix with sparsity that adapts to the data automatically. We achieve this by formulating a hierarchical Bayesian model of the precision matrix with a non-informative Jeffreys’ hyperprior. We also naturally enforce the symmetry and positive-definiteness constraints on the precision matrix by parameterizing it with the Cholesky decomposition. Experiments on simulated and real (cell signaling) data demonstrate that the proposed approach not only automatically adapts the sparsity of the model, but it also results in improved estimates of the precision matrix compared to the Laplace prior model with sparsity parameter chosen by cross-validation."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/grinberg13.pdf,Average Reward Optimization Objective In Partially Observable Domains,"Yuri Grinberg, Doina Precup","We consider the problem of average reward optimization in domains with partial observability, within the modeling framework of linear predictive state representations (PSRs). The key to average-reward computation is to have a well-defined stationary behavior of a system, so the required averages can be computed. If, additionally, the stationary behavior varies smoothly with changes in policy parameters, average-reward control through policy search also becomes a possibility. In this paper, we show that PSRs have a well-behaved stationary distribution, which is a rational function of policy parameters. Based on this result, we define a related reward process particularly suitable for average reward optimization, and analyze its properties. We show that in such a predictive state reward process, the average reward is a rational function of the policy parameters, whose complexity depends on the dimension of the underlying linear PSR. This result suggests that average reward-based policy search methods can be effective when the dimension of the system is small, even when the system representation in the POMDP framework requires many hidden states. We provide illustrative examples of this type."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/kolar13.pdf,Feature Selection in High-Dimensional Classification,"Mladen Kolar, Han Liu","High-dimensional discriminant analysis is of fundamental importance in multivariate statistics. Existing theoretical results sharply characterize different procedures, providing sharp convergence results for the classification risk, as well as the l2 convergence results to the discriminative rule. However, sharp theoretical results for the problem of variable selection have not been established, even though model interpretation is of importance in many scientific domains. In this paper, we bridge this gap by providing sharp sufficient conditions for consistent variable selection using the ROAD estimator (Fan et al., 2010). Our results provide novel theoretical insights for the ROAD estimator. Sufficient conditions are complemented by the necessary information theoretic limits on variable selection in high-dimensional discriminant analysis. This complementary result also establishes optimality of the ROAD estimator for a certain family of problems."

This puts limits on human learning ability and on the kinds of learning tasks humans can easily handle. In this paper, we consider the problem of “boosting” human learners to extend the learning ability of human learners and achieve improved performance on tasks which individual humans find difficult. We consider classification (category learning) tasks, propose a boosting algorithm for human learners and give theoretical justifications. We conduct experiments using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk on two synthetic datasets – a crosshair task with a nonlinear decision boundary and a gabor patch task with a linear boundary but which is inaccessible to human learners – and one real world dataset – the Opinion Spam detection task introduced in (Ott et al). Our results show that boosting human learners produces gains in accuracy and can overcome some fundamental limitations of human learners."

Given a pair of tall-and-thin matrices, the proposed algorithm first employs a randomized dimensionality reduction transform to reduce the size of the input matrices, and then applies any standard CCA algorithm to the new pair of matrices. The algorithm computes an approximate CCA to the original pair of matrices with provable guarantees, while requiring asymptotically less operations than the state-of-the-art exact algorithms."

We believe the relationship between these two classes of events—something not previously studied quantitatively—could yield important insights into the nature and intrinsic dynamics of seizures. A goal of our work is to parse these complex epileptic events into distinct dynamic regimes. A challenge posed by the intracranial EEG (iEEG) data we study is the fact that the number and placement of electrodes can vary between patients. We develop a Bayesian nonparametric Markov switching process that allows for (i) shared dynamic regimes between a variable numbers of channels, (ii) asynchronous regime-switching, and (iii) an unknown dictionary of dynamic regimes. We encode a sparse and changing set of dependencies between the channels using a Markov-switching Gaussian graphical model for the innovations process driving the channel dynamics. We demonstrate the importance of this model in parsing and out-of-sample predictions of iEEG data. We show that our model produces intuitive state assignments that can help automate clinical analysis of seizures and enable the comparison of sub-clinical bursts and full clinical seizures."

We argue that the complexity of convex minimization is only determined by the rate of growth of the function around its minimum x^*_f,S, as quantified by a Tsybakov-like noise condition. Specifically, we prove that if f grows at least as fast as \|x-x^*_f,S\|^κaround its minimum, for some κ> 1, then the optimal rate of learning f(x^*_f,S) is Θ(T^-\fracκ2κ-2). The classic rate Θ(1/\sqrt T) for convex functions and Θ(1/T) for strongly convex functions are special cases of our result for κ→∞and κ=2, and even faster rates are attained for 1 < κ< 2. We also derive tight bounds for the complexity of learning x_f,S^*, where the optimal rate is Θ(T^-\frac12κ-2). Interestingly, these precise rates also characterize the complexity of active learning and our results further strengthen the connections between the fields of active learning and convex optimization, both of which rely on feedback-driven queries."

When the number of kernels d to be combined is very large, multiple kernel learning methods whose computational cost scales linearly in d are intractable. We propose a randomized version of the mirror descent algorithm to overcome this issue, under the objective of minimizing the group p-norm penalized empirical risk. The key to achieve the required exponential speed-up is the computationally efficient construction of low-variance estimates of the gradient. We propose importance sampling based estimates, and find that the ideal distribution samples a coordinate with a probability proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding gradient. We show that in the case of learning the coefficients of a polynomial kernel, the combinatorial structure of the base kernels to be combined allows sampling from this distribution in O(\log(d)) time, making the total computational cost of the method to achieve an epsilon-optimal solution to be O(\log(d)/epsilon^2), thereby allowing our method to operate for very large values of d. Experiments with simulated and real data confirm that the new algorithm is computationally more efficient than its state-of-the-art alternatives."

Particularly in high-dimensional applications, this is often not the case. Worse yet, even estimating statistics of the noise (the noise covariance) can be a central challenge. In this paper we develop a simple variant of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for precisely this setting. We show that without knowledge of the noise covariance, our algorithm recovers the support, and we provide matching lower bounds that show that our algorithm performs at the minimax optimal rate. While simple, this is the first algorithm that (provably) recovers support in a noise-distribution-oblivious manner. When knowledge of the noise-covariance is available, our algorithm matches the best-known \ell^2-recovery bounds available. We show that these too are min-max optimal. Along the way, we also obtain improved performance guarantees for OMP for the standard sparse regression problem with Gaussian noise."

Basically our methods are combinations of basic stochastic optimization techniques and Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM). ADMM is a general framework for optimizing a composite function, and has a wide range of applications. We propose two types of online variants of ADMM, which correspond to online proximal gradient descent and regularized dual averaging respectively. The proposed algorithms are computationally efficient and easy to implement. Our methods yield O(1/\sqrtT) convergence of the expected risk. Moreover, the online proximal gradient descent type method yields O(\log(T)/T) convergence for a strongly convex loss. Numerical experiments show effectiveness of our methods in learning tasks with structured sparsity such as overlapped group lasso."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/shin13.pdf,A New Frontier of Kernel Design for Structured Data,Kilho Shin,"Many kernels for discretely structured data in the literature are designed within the framework of the convolution kernel and its generalization, the mapping kernel. The two most important advantages to use this framework is an easy-to-check criteria of positive definiteness and efficient computation based on the dynamic programming methodology of the resulting kernels. On the other hand, the recent theory of partitionable kernels reveals that the known kernels only take advantage of a very small portion of the potential of the framework. In fact, we have good opportunities to find novel and important kernels in the unexplored area. In this paper, we shed light on a novel important class of kernels within the framework: We give a mathematical characterization of the class, show a parametric method to optimize kernels of the class to specific problems, based on this characterization, and present some experimental results, which show the new kernels are promising in both accuracy and efficiency."

Ideally, this is achieved by training on very large (infinite) training data sets that capture all variations in the data distribution. In the case of finite training data, an effective solution is to extend the training set with artificially created examples – which, however, is also computationally costly. We propose to corrupt training examples with noise from known distributions within the exponential family and present a novel learning algorithm, called marginalized corrupted features (MCF), that trains robust predictors by minimizing the expected value of the loss function under the corrupting distribution – essentially learning with infinitely many (corrupted) training examples. We show empirically on a variety of data sets that MCF classifiers can be trained efficiently, may generalize substantially better to test data, and are more robust to feature deletion at test time."

However, DBNs are frequently applied to model real-valued data, and so far little is known about their representational power in this case. We analyze the approximation properties of DBNs with two layers of binary hidden units and visible units with conditional distributions from the exponential family. It is shown that these DBNs can, under mild assumptions, model any additive mixture of distributions from the exponential family with independent variables. An arbitrarily good approximation in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence of an m-dimensional mixture distribution with n components can be achieved by a DBN with m visible variables and n and n+1 hidden variables in the first and second hidden layer, respectively. Furthermore, relevant infinite mixtures can be approximated arbitrarily well by a DBN with a finite number of neurons. This includes the important special case of an infinite mixture of Gaussian distributions with fixed variance restricted to a compact domain, which in turn can approximate any strictly positive density over this domain."

Our analysis also holds if the linear subproblems are only solved approximately (as well as if the gradients are inexact), and is proven to be worst-case optimal in the sparsity of the obtained solutions. On the application side, this allows us to unify a large variety of existing sparse greedy methods, in particular for optimization over convex hulls of an atomic set, even if those sets can only be approximated, including sparse (or structured sparse) vectors or matrices, low-rank matrices, permutation matrices, or max-norm bounded matrices. We present a new general framework for convex optimization over matrix factorizations, where every Frank-Wolfe iteration will consist of a low-rank update, and discuss the broad application areas of this approach."

One challenge of collaborative filtering is how to utilize available auxiliary information to improve prediction accuracy. In this paper, we study the problem of utilizing auxiliary information as features of factorization and propose formalizing the problem as general functional matrix factorization, whose model includes conventional matrix factorization models as its special cases. Moreover, we propose a gradient boosting based algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Finally, we give two specific algorithms for efficient feature function construction for two specific tasks. Our method can construct more suitable feature functions by searching in an infinite functional space based on training data and thus can yield better prediction accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods on three real-world datasets."

Hence, an ideal network should be able to 1) gradually learn a set of patterns, 2) retrieve the correct pattern from noisy queries and 3) maximize the number of memorized patterns while maintaining the reliability in responding to queries. We show that by considering the inherent redundancy in the memorized patterns, one can obtain all the mentioned properties at once. This is in sharp contrast with the previous work that could only improve one or two aspects at the expense of the third. More specifically, we devise an iterative algorithm that learns the redundancy among the patterns. The resulting network has a retrieval capacity that is exponential in the size of the network. Lastly, by considering the local structures of the network, the asymptotic error correction performance can be made linear in the size of the network."

Advances in GP scaling have not been extended to the multidimensional input setting, despite the preponderance of multidimensional applications. This paper introduces and tests a novel method of projected additive approximation to multidimensional GPs. We thoroughly illustrate the power of this method on several datasets, achieving close performance to the naive Full GP at orders of magnitude less cost."

This means that usually there is not one optimal design but an entire set of Pareto-optimal ones with optimal tradeoffs in the objectives. In many applications, evaluating one design is expensive; thus, an exhaustive search for the Pareto-optimal set is unfeasible. To address this challenge, we propose the Pareto Active Learning (PAL) algorithm, which intelligently samples the design space to predict the Pareto-optimal set. Key features of PAL include (1) modeling the objectives as samples from a Gaussian process distribution to capture structure and accommodate noisy evaluation; (2) a method to carefully choose the next design to evaluate to maximize progress; and (3) the ability to control prediction accuracy and sampling cost. We provide theoretical bounds on PAL’s sampling cost required to achieve a desired accuracy. Further, we show an experimental evaluation on three real-world data sets. The results show PAL’s effectiveness; in particular it improves significantly over a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm, saving in many cases about 33%."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/kadri13.pdf,A Generalized Kernel Approach to Structured Output Learning,"Hachem Kadri, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Philippe Preux","We study the problem of structured output learning from a regression perspective. We first provide a general formulation of the kernel dependency estimation (KDE) approach to this problem using operator-valued kernels. Our formulation overcomes the two main limitations of the original KDE approach, namely the decoupling between outputs in the image space and the inability to use a joint feature space. We then propose a covariance-based operator-valued kernel that allows us to take into account the structure of the kernel feature space. This kernel operates on the output space and only encodes the interactions between the outputs without any reference to the input space. To address this issue, we introduce a variant of our KDE method based on the conditional covariance operator that in addition to the correlation between the outputs takes into account the effects of the input variables. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our KDE approach using both covariance and conditional covariance kernels on three structured output problems, and compare it to the state-of-the art kernel-based structured output regression methods."

We revisit the aggressive approach for active learning in the realizable case, and show that it can be made efficient and practical, while also having theoretical guarantees under reasonable assumptions. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that it can be preferable to mellow approaches. Our efficient aggressive active learner of half-spaces has formal approximation guarantees that hold when the pool is separable with a margin. While our analysis is focused on the realizable setting, we show that a simple heuristic allows using the same algorithm successfully for pools with low error as well. We further compare the aggressive approach to the mellow approach, and prove that there are cases in which the aggressive approach results in significantly better label complexity compared to the mellow approach. We demonstrate experimentally that substantial improvements in label complexity can be achieved using the aggressive approach, for both realizable and low-error settings."

We study the dependence of the statistical ranking problem on the available pairwise data, i.e., pairs (i,j) for which the pairwise comparison data y_ij is known, and propose a framework to identify data which, when augmented with the current dataset, maximally increases the Fisher information of the ranking. Under certain assumptions, the data collection problem decouples, reducing to a problem of finding an edge set on the graph (with a fixed number of edges) such that the second eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian is maximal. This reduction of the data collection problem to a spectral graph-theoretic question is one of the primary contributions of this work. As an application, we study the Yahoo! Movie user rating dataset and demonstrate that the addition of a small number of well-chosen pairwise comparisons can significantly increase the Fisher informativeness of the ranking."

In this paper, we develop a method for online multi-task learning in the lifelong learning setting. The proposed Efficient Lifelong Learning Algorithm (ELLA) maintains a sparsely shared basis for all task models, transfers knowledge from the basis to learn each new task, and refines the basis over time to maximize performance across all tasks. We show that ELLA has strong connections to both online dictionary learning for sparse coding and state-of-the-art batch multi-task learning methods, and provide robust theoretical performance guarantees. We show empirically that ELLA yields nearly identical performance to batch multi-task learning while learning tasks sequentially in three orders of magnitude (over 1,000x) less time."

Increasingly, however, in several applications, ranging from ranking and biometric screening to medical diagnosis, performance is measured not in terms of the full area under the ROC curve, but instead, in terms of the partial area under the ROC curve between two specified false positive rates. In this paper, we develop a structural SVM framework for directly optimizing the partial AUC between any two false positive rates. Our approach makes use of a cutting plane solver along the lines of the structural SVM based approach for optimizing the full AUC developed by Joachims (2005). Unlike the full AUC, where the combinatorial optimization problem needed to find the most violated constraint in the cutting plane solver can be decomposed easily to yield an efficient algorithm, the corresponding optimization problem in the case of partial AUC is harder to decompose. One of our key technical contributions is an efficient algorithm for solving this combinatorial optimization problem that has the same computational complexity as Joachims’ algorithm for optimizing the usual AUC. This allows us to efficiently optimize the partial AUC in any desired false positive range. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of real-world tasks."

This is an NP-hard problem and most approaches consider local search techniques. In this paper, we pose it as a combinatorial optimization problem, which is then relaxed to a convex optimization problem that involves searching over the forest and hyperforest polytopes with special structures. A supergradient method is used to solve the dual problem, with a run-time complexity of O(k^3 n^k+2 \log n) for each iteration, where n is the number of variables and k is a bound on the treewidth. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art methods on synthetic datasets and classical benchmarks, showing the gains of the novel convex approach."

Classification tasks, in which workers provide labels (such as “offensive” or “not offensive”) for instances (such as websites), are among the most common tasks posted, but due to a mix of human error and the overwhelming prevalence of spam, the labels collected are often noisy. This problem is typically addressed by collecting labels for each instance from multiple workers and combining them in a clever way. However, the question of how to choose which tasks to assign to each worker is often overlooked. We investigate the problem of task assignment and label inference for heterogeneous classification tasks. By applying online primal-dual techniques, we derive a provably near-optimal adaptive assignment algorithm. We show that adaptively assigning workers to tasks can lead to more accurate predictions at a lower cost when the available workers are diverse."

This process is not assumed to be a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Rather, the agent has several representations (mapping histories of past interactions to a discrete state space) of the environment with unknown dynamics, only some of which result in an MDP. The goal is to minimize the average regret criterion against an agent who knows an MDP representation giving the highest optimal reward, and acts optimally in it. Recent regret bounds for this setting are of order O(T^2/3) with an additive term constant yet exponential in some characteristics of the optimal MDP. We propose an algorithm whose regret after T time steps is O(\sqrtT), with all constants reasonably small. This is optimal in T since O(\sqrtT) is the optimal regret in the setting of learning in a (single discrete) MDP."

We study the following related conjecture: better representations, in the sense of better disentangling, can be exploited to produce Markov chains that mix faster between modes. Consequently, mixing between modes would be more efficient at higher levels of representation. To better understand this, we propose a secondary conjecture: the higher-level samples fill more uniformly the space they occupy and the high-density manifolds tend to unfold when represented at higher levels. The paper discusses these hypotheses and tests them experimentally through visualization and measurements of mixing between modes and interpolating between samples."

To address this lacuna, we extend LDA by drawing topics from a Dirichlet process whose base distribution is a distribution over all strings rather than from a finite Dirichlet. We develop inference using online variational inference and because we only can consider a finite number of words for each truncated topic propose heuristics to dynamically organize, expand, and contract the set of words we consider in our vocabulary truncation. We show our model can successfully incorporate new words as it encounters new terms and that it performs better than online LDA in evaluations of topic quality and classification performance."

Previous online optimization methods are designed to have a total accumulated loss comparable to that of the best comparator sequence, and existing tracking or shifting regret bounds scale with the overall variation of the comparator sequence. In many practical scenarios, however, the environment is nonstationary and comparator sequences with small variation are quite weak, resulting in large losses. The proposed dynamic mirror descent method, in contrast, can yield low regret relative to highly variable comparator sequences by both tracking the best dynamical model and forming predictions based on that model. This concept is demonstrated empirically in the context of sequential compressive observations of a dynamic scene and tracking a dynamic social network."

However, if the controller is a human or animal subject, the subject’s internal dynamics model may differ from the true plant dynamics. Here, we consider the problem of learning the subject’s internal model from demonstrations of control and knowledge of task goals. Due to sensory feedback delay, the subject uses an internal model to generate an internal prediction of the current plant state, which may differ from the actual plant state. We develop a probabilistic framework and exact EM algorithm to jointly estimate the internal model, internal state trajectories, and feedback delay. We applied this framework to demonstrations by a nonhuman primate of brain-machine interface (BMI) control. We discovered that the subject’s internal model deviated from the true BMI plant dynamics and provided significantly better explanation of the recorded neural control signals than did the true plant dynamics."

As these optimization problems are typically NP-hard, one uses convex or spectral relaxations in practice. While these relaxations can be solved globally optimally, they are often too loose and thus lead to results far away from the optimum. In this paper we show that every constrained minimization problem of a ratio of non-negative set functions allows a tight relaxation into an unconstrained continuous optimization problem. This result leads to a flexible framework for solving constrained problems in network analysis. While a globally optimal solution for the resulting non-convex problem cannot be guaranteed, we outperform the loose convex or spectral relaxations by a large margin on constrained local clustering problems."

Our method is formulated as a convex quadratic program that guarantees optimal weights against a worst-case adversary in polynomial time. In addition to increased robustness against active adversaries, this kind of adversarial regularization can also lead to improved generalization even when no adversary is present. In experiments on real and simulated data, our method consistently outperforms both non-adversarial and non-relational baselines."

In this paper, the learning task is cast as combinatorial optimization problem: given a set of positive and negative feature vectors in the Euclidean space, the goal is to find a discrete linear function that minimizes the cumulative hinge loss of this training set. Since this problem is NP-hard, we propose two simple rounding algorithms that discretize the fractional solution of the problem. Generalization bounds are derived for two important classes of binary-weighted linear functions, by establishing the Rademacher complexity of these classes and proving approximation bounds for rounding methods. These methods are compared on both synthetic and real-world data."

Vine factorizations ease the learning of high-dimensional copulas by constructing a hierarchy of conditional bivariate copulas. However, to simplify inference, it is common to assume that each of these conditional bivariate copulas is independent from its conditioning variables. In this paper, we relax this assumption by discovering the latent functions that specify the shape of a conditional copula given its conditioning variables. We learn these functions by following a Bayesian approach based on sparse Gaussian processes with expectation propagation for scalable, approximate inference. Experiments on real-world datasets show that, when modeling all conditional dependencies, we obtain better estimates of the underlying copula of the data."

We consider a very weak assumption on the function, namely that it is locally smooth (in some precise sense) with respect to some semi-metric, around one of its global maxima. Compared to previous works on bandits in general spaces (Kleinberg et al., 2008; Bubeck et al., 2011a) our algorithm does not require the knowledge of this semi-metric. Our algorithm, StoSOO, follows an optimistic strategy to iteratively construct upper confidence bounds over the hierarchical partitions of the function domain to decide which point to sample next. A finite-time analysis of StoSOO shows that it performs almost as well as the best specifically-tuned algorithms even though the local smoothness of the function is not known."

Here we address the problem of adapting simultaneously the number of samples into each stratum and the stratification itself. We show a tradeoff in the size of the partitioning. On the one hand it is important to refine the partition in areas where the observation noise or the function are heterogeneous in order to reduce this variability. But on the other hand, a too refined stratification makes it harder to assign the samples according to a near-optimal (oracle) allocation strategy. In this paper we provide an algorithm \em Monte-Carlo Upper-Lower Confidence Bound that selects online, among a large class of partitions, the partition that provides a near-optimal trade-off, and allocates the samples almost optimally on this partition."

Recent theoretical investigations have demonstrated their superiority over the convex counterparts in several sparse learning settings. However, solving the non-convex optimization problems associated with non-convex penalties remains a big challenge. A commonly used approach is the Multi-Stage (MS) convex relaxation (or DC programming), which relaxes the original non-convex problem to a sequence of convex problems. This approach is usually not very practical for large-scale problems because its computational cost is a multiple of solving a single convex problem. In this paper, we propose a General Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding (GIST) algorithm to solve the nonconvex optimization problem for a large class of non-convex penalties. The GIST algorithm iteratively solves a proximal operator problem, which in turn has a closed-form solution for many commonly used penalties. At each outer iteration of the algorithm, we use a line search initialized by the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) rule that allows finding an appropriate step size quickly. The paper also presents a detailed convergence analysis of the GIST algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by extensive experiments on large-scale data sets."

Our motivation rests in the Thurstonian view that many discrete data types can be considered as being generated from a subset of underlying latent continuous variables, and in the observation that each realisation of a discrete type imposes certain inequalities on those variables. Thus learning and inference in TBM reduce to making sense of a set of inequalities. Our proposed TBM naturally supports the following types: Gaussian, intervals, censored, binary, categorical, muticategorical, ordinal, (in)-complete rank with and without ties. We demonstrate the versatility and capacity of the proposed model on three applications of very different natures; namely handwritten digit recognition, collaborative filtering and complex social survey analysis."

We explore a parametric approach to this problem, assuming that the number of topics is known or can be estimated by cross-validation. The models we consider can be viewed as special (finite-dimensional) instances of hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs). For these models we show that there exists a simple variational approximation for probabilistic inference. The approximation relies on a previously unexploited inequality that handles the conditional dependence between Dirichlet latent variables in adjacent levels of the model’s hierarchy. We compare our approach to existing implementations of nonparametric HDPs. On several benchmarks we find that our approach is faster than Gibbs sampling and able to learn more predictive models than existing variational methods. Finally, we demonstrate the large-scale viability of our approach on two newly available corpora from researchers in computer security–one with 350,000 documents and over 6,000 internal subcategories, the other with a five-level deep hierarchy."

We derive the distance between ellipsoids and the hyperplane, generalising the standard support vector machine. Negative bags in MIL contain only negative instances, and we treat them akin to uncertain observations in the robust optimisation framework. However, our method allows positive bags to cross the margin, since it is not known which instances within are positive. We show that representing bags as ellipsoids under the introduced distance is the most robust solution when treating a bag as a random variable with finite mean and covariance. Two algorithms are derived to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem: a concave-convex procedure and a quasi-Newton method. Our method achieves competitive results on benchmark datasets. We introduce a MIL dataset from a real world application of detecting wheel defects from multiple partial observations, and show that eMIL outperforms competing approaches."

Correlation measures are generally used to quantify the connections between equities. The 2008 financial crisis, and its aftermath, demonstrated the need for a better way to quantify these connections. We present a machine learning-based method to build a connectedness matrix to address the shortcomings of correlation in capturing events such as large losses. Our method uses an unconstrained optimization to learn this matrix, while ensuring that the resulting matrix is positive semi-definite. We show that this matrix can be used to build portfolios that not only “beat the market,” but also outperform optimal (i.e., minimum variance) portfolios."

Dropout training (Hinton et al., 2012) does this by randomly dropping out (zeroing) hidden units and input features during training of neural networks. However, repeatedly sampling a random subset of input features makes training much slower. Based on an examination of the implied objective function of dropout training, we show how to do fast dropout training by sampling from or integrating a Gaussian approximation, instead of doing Monte Carlo optimization of this objective. This approximation, justified by the central limit theorem and empirical evidence, gives an order of magnitude speedup and more stability. We show how to do fast dropout training for classification, regression, and multilayer neural networks. Beyond dropout, our technique is extended to integrate out other types of noise and small image transformations."

We demonstrate that the obvious approach of subsampling produces inferior results and propose a generic approximated optimization technique that reduces the NE optimization cost to O(n log n). The technique is based on realizing that in visualization the embedding space is necessarily very low-dimensional (2D or 3D), and hence efficient approximations developed for n-body force calculations can be applied. In gradient-based NE algorithms the gradient for an individual point decomposes into “forces” exerted by the other points. The contributions of close-by points need to be computed individually but far-away points can be approximated by their “center of mass”, rapidly computable by applying a recursive decomposition of the visualization space into quadrants. The new algorithm brings a significant speed-up for medium-size data, and brings “big data” within reach of visualization."

All these algorithms aim to obtain coherent biclusters and it is crucial to have a reliable procedure for their validation. We point out the problem of size bias in biclustering evaluation and show how it can lead to wrong conclusions in a comparative study. We present the theoretical corrections for all of the most popular measures in order to remove this bias. We introduce the corrected precision-recall space that combines the advantages of corrected measures, the ease of interpretation and visualization of uncorrected measures. Numerical experiments demonstrate the interest of our approach."

Such tasks arise in many applications, such as the analysis of social networks and in systems-biology where researchers try to infer functional grouping of biological agents based on their pairwise interactions. We analyze the computational complexity of the resulting optimization problem. We present a polynomial time approximation algorithm for this bi-clustering task and complement this result by showing that finding (exact) optimal solutions is NP-hard. As far as we know, these are the first positive approximation guarantees and formal NP-hardness results for any bi-clustering optimization problem. In addition, we show that our optimization problem can be efficiently solved by deterministic annealing, yielding a promising heuristic for large problem instances."

Several techniques have been recently proposed to model the relation between two images, with application to pose estimation, action recognition or invariant object recognition. Among these techniques, higher-order Boltzmann machines or relational autoencoders consider projections of the images on different subspaces and intermediate layers act as transformation specific detectors. In this work, we extend the mathematical study of (Memisevic, 2012b) to show that it is possible to use a unique projection for both images in a way that turns intermediate layers as spectrum encoders of transformations. We show that this results in networks that are easier to tune and have greater generalization capabilities."

It is known their minimum values are monotone with respect to the input number of clusters and this monotonicity does not allow for a simple automatic selection of a correct number of clusters. Here we study monotonicity not just on the minimizers but on the entire clustering lattice. We show the value of Sum of Squares Error is strictly monotone under the strict refinement relation of clusterings and we obtain data-dependent bounds on the difference between the value of a clustering and one of its refinements. Using analogous techniques we show the value of Normalized Cut is strictly anti-monotone. These results imply that even if we restrict our solutions to form a chain of clustering, like the one we get from hierarchical algorithms, we cannot rely on the functional values in order to choose the number of clusters. By using these results we get some data-dependent bounds on the difference of the values of any two clusterings."

Here the data are assumed to come from a stationary Gaussian VAR time series. By formulating the problem as a linear program, we provide a new approach to conduct inference on such models. In theory, under a doubly asymptotic framework in which both the sample size T and dimensionality d of the time series can increase, we provide explicit rates of convergence between the estimator and the population transition matrix under different matrix norms. Our results show that the spectral norm of the transition matrix plays a pivotal role in determining the final rates of convergence. This is the first work analyzing the estimation of transition matrices under a high dimensional doubly asymptotic framework. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world stock data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the existing methods. The results of this paper have broad impact on different applications, including finance, genomics, and brain imaging."

We present a general approach for converting an algorithm which has linear time in the size of the set to a sublinear one via label partitioning. Our method consists of learning an input partition and a label assignment to each partition of the space such that precision at k is optimized, which is the loss function of interest in this setting. Experiments on large-scale ranking and recommendation tasks show that our method not only makes the original linear time algorithm computationally tractable, but can also improve its performance."

It has many variants sharing a common flavor of passing ""messages"" over some graph-object. Recent advances revealed that its convergent versions (such as MPLP, MSD, TRW-S) can be viewed as performing block coordinate descent (BCD) in a dual objective. That is, each BCD step achieves dual-optimal w.r.t. a block of dual variables (messages), thereby decreases the dual objective monotonically. However, most existing algorithms are limited to updating blocks selected in rather restricted ways. In this paper, we show a ""unified"" message passing algorithm that: (a) subsumes MPLP, MSD, and TRW-S as special cases when applied to their respective choices of dual objective and blocks, and (b) is able to perform BCD under much more flexible choices of blocks (including very large blocks) as well as the dual objective itself (that arise from an arbitrary dual decomposition)."

Today’s computing infrastructures allow bigger evaluation budgets, thus opening the way for algorithmic approaches. Recently, surrogate-based optimization was successfully applied to hyperparameter learning for deep belief networks and to WEKA classifiers. The methods combined brute force computational power with model building about the behavior of the error function in the hyperparameter space, and they could significantly improve on manual hyperparameter tuning. What may make experienced practitioners even better at hyperparameter optimization is their ability to generalize across similar learning problems. In this paper, we propose a generic method to incorporate knowledge from previous experiments when simultaneously tuning a learning algorithm on new problems at hand. To this end, we combine surrogate-based ranking and optimization techniques for surrogate-based collaborative tuning (SCoT). We demonstrate SCoT in two experiments where it outperforms standard tuning techniques and single-problem surrogate-based optimization."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/cai13.pdf,SADA: A General Framework to Support Robust Causation Discovery,"Ruichu Cai, Zhenjie Zhang, Zhifeng Hao","Causality discovery without manipulation is considered a crucial problem to a variety of applications, such as genetic therapy. The state-of-the-art solutions, e.g. LiNGAM, return accurate results when the number of labeled samples is larger than the number of variables. These approaches are thus applicable only when large numbers of samples are available or the problem domain is sufficiently small. Motivated by the observations of the local sparsity properties on causal structures, we propose a general Split-and-Merge strategy, named SADA, to enhance the scalability of a wide class of causality discovery algorithms. SADA is able to accurately identify the causal variables, even when the sample size is significantly smaller than the number of variables. In SADA, the variables are partitioned into subsets, by finding cuts on the sparse probabilistic graphical model over the variables. By running mainstream causation discovery algorithms, e.g. LiNGAM, on the subproblems, complete causality can be reconstructed by combining all the partial results. SADA benefits from the recursive division technique, since each small subproblem generates more accurate result under the same number of samples. We theoretically prove that SADA always reduces the scale of problems without significant sacrifice on result accuracy, depending only on the local sparsity condition over the variables. Experiments on real-world datasets verify the improvements on scalability and accuracy by applying SADA on top of existing causation algorithms."

However, it is still challenging to learn useful high-level features when the data contains a significant amount of irrelevant patterns. Although feature selection can be used for such complex data, it may fail when we have to build a learning system from scratch (i.e., starting from the lack of useful raw features). To address this problem, we propose a point-wise gated Boltzmann machine, a unified generative model that combines feature learning and feature selection. Our model performs not only feature selection on learned high-level features (i.e., hidden units), but also dynamic feature selection on raw features (i.e., visible units) through a gating mechanism. For each example, the model can adaptively focus on a variable subset of visible nodes corresponding to the task-relevant patterns, while ignoring the visible units corresponding to the task-irrelevant patterns. In experiments, our method achieves improved performance over state-of-the-art in several visual recognition benchmarks."

In this problem, the user is navigated to the items of interest through a series of options and our objective is to learn a better search policy from past interactions with the user. We propose an efficient learning algorithm for solving the problem, sequential Bayesian search (SBS), and prove that it is Bayesian optimal. We also analyze the algorithm from the frequentist point of view and show that its regret is sublinear in the number of searches.

We find the models to be significantly correlated with a human-curated influence measure, and to clearly outperform a baseline method. Further using the learned model to study properties of influence, we find that musical influence and musical innovation are not monotonically correlated. However, we do find that the most influential songs were more innovative during two time periods: the early 1970’s and the mid 1990’s."

LDA though successful in detecting prominent concerns, fails to detect many useful CCCs including ones that may be heavily executed but elude discovery because they do not have a strong prevalence in source-code. We pose this problem as that of discovering topics that rarely occur in individual documents, which we will refer to as subtle topics. Recently an interesting approach, namely focused topic models(FTM) was proposed for detecting rare topics. FTM, though successful in detecting topics which occur prominently in very few documents, is unable to detect subtle topics. Discovering subtle topics thus remains an important open problem. To address this issue we propose subtle topic models(STM). STM uses a generalized stick breaking process(GSBP) as a prior for defining multiple distributions over topics. This hierarchical structure on topics allows STM to discover rare topics beyond the capabilities of FTM. The associated inference is non-standard and is solved by exploiting the relationship between GSBP and generalized Dirichlet distribution. Empirical results show that STM is able to discover subtle CCC in two benchmark code-bases, a feat which is beyond the scope of existing topic models, thus demonstrating the potential of the model in automated concern discovery, a known difficult problem in Software Engineering. Furthermore it is observed that even in general text corpora STM outperforms the state of art in discovering subtle topics."

Most approaches to topic model learning have been based on a maximum likelihood objective. Efficient algorithms exist that attempt to approximate this objective, but they have no provable guarantees. Recently, algorithms have been introduced that provide provable bounds, but these algorithms are not practical because they are inefficient and not robust to violations of model assumptions.

With the advent of large-scale data it is common to find scenarios where the number of possible multinomial outcomes is large (in the order of thousands to tens of thousands). In such cases, the computational cost of training logistic models or even simply iterating through all the model parameters is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose a training method for large-scale multinomial logistic models that breaks this bottleneck by enabling parallel optimization of the likelihood objective.

It optimizes the variational objective with stochastic optimization, following noisy estimates of the natural gradient. Operationally, stochastic inference iteratively subsamples from the data, analyzes the subsample, and updates parameters with a decreasing learning rate. However, the algorithm is sensitive to that rate, which usually requires hand-tuning to each application. We solve this problem by developing an adaptive learning rate for stochastic inference. Our method requires no tuning and is easily implemented with computations already made in the algorithm. We demonstrate our approach with latent Dirichlet allocation applied to three large text corpora. Inference with the adaptive learning rate converges faster and to a better approximation than the best settings of hand-tuned rates."

In this way, when the unscaled step size is an optimal choice, these results provide guarantees for Friedman’s empirically successful “shrinkage” procedure for gradient boosting (Friedman, 2000). Guarantees are also provided for a variety of other step sizes, affirming the intuition that increasingly regularized line searches provide improved margin guarantees. The results hold for the exponential loss and similar losses, most notably the logistic loss."

Kernel CCA (KCCA) is the most notable nonlinear extension but it lacks interpretability and robustness against irrelevant features. The aim of this article is to introduce two nonlinear CCA extensions that rely on the recently proposed Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion and the centered kernel target alignment. These extensions determine linear projections that provide maximally dependent projected data pairs. The paper demonstrates that the use of linear projections allows removing irrelevant features, whilst extracting combinations of strongly associated features. This is exemplified through a simulation and the analysis of recorded data that are available in the literature."

Sculley, Brendan McMahan, Michael Young","We reduce the memory footprint of popular large-scale online learning methods by projecting our weight vector onto a coarse discrete set using randomized rounding. Compared to standard 32-bit float encodings, this reduces RAM usage by more than 50% during training and by up 95% when making predictions from a fixed model, with almost no loss in accuracy. We also show that randomized counting can be used to implement per-coordinate learning rates, improving model quality with little additional RAM. We prove these memory-saving methods achieve regret guarantees similar to their exact variants. Empirical evaluation confirms excellent performance, dominating standard approaches across memory versus accuracy tradeoffs."

We propose a randomized algorithm that, with high probability, gives a constant-factor approximation of a general discrete integral defined over an exponentially large set. This algorithm relies on solving only a small number of instances of a discrete combinatorial optimization problem subject to randomly generated parity constraints used as a hash function. As an application, we demonstrate that with a small number of MAP queries we can efficiently approximate the partition function of discrete graphical models, which can in turn be used, for instance, for marginal computation or model selection."

The central assumption of our learning method is that the tasks parameters are well approximated by sparse linear combinations of the atoms of a dictionary on a high or infinite dimensional space. This assumption, together with the large quantity of available data in the multitask and transfer learning settings, allows a principled choice of the dictionary. We provide bounds on the generalization error of this approach, for both settings. Numerical experiments on one synthetic and two real datasets show the advantage of our method over single task learning, a previous method based on orthogonal and dense representation of the tasks and a related method learning task grouping."

Recently, the research community seeks to improve these view-invariant representations further by additional invariance and receptive field learning, or by taking on the challenge of processing massive amounts of learning data. In this paper we consider an alternate strategy of directly modeling complex invariances of object features. While this may sound like a naive and inferior approach, our experiments show that this approach can achieve competitive and state-of-the-art accuracy on visual recognition data sets such as CIFAR-10 and STL-10. We present an highly applicable dictionary learning algorithm on complex invariances that can be used in most feature pooling network settings. It also has the merits of simplicity and requires no additional tuning. We also discuss the implication of our experiment results concerning recent observations on the usefulness of pre-trained features, and the role of direct invariance modeling in invariance learning."

In particular we consider single-molecule experiments which indirectly measure the distinct steps in a biomolecular process via observations of noisy time-dependent signals such as a fluorescence intensity or bead position. Straightforward hidden Markov model (HMM) analyses attempt to characterize such processes in terms of a set of conformational states, the transitions that can occur between these states, and the associated rates at which those transitions occur; but require ad-hoc post-processing steps to combine multiple signals. Here we develop a hierarchically coupled HMM that allows experimentalists to deal with inter-signal variability in a principled and automatic way. Our approach is a generalized expectation maximization hyperparameter point estimation procedure with variational Bayes at the level of individual time series that learns an single interpretable representation of the overall data generating process."

At the same time, significantly less effort has been devoted to adapting bandit algorithms to particular architectures, such as sensor networks, multi-core machines, or peer-to-peer (P2P) environments, which could potentially speed up their convergence. Our goal is to adapt stochastic bandit algorithms to P2P networks. In our setup, the same set of arms is available in each peer. In every iteration each peer can pull one arm independently of the other peers, and then some limited communication is possible with a few random other peers. As our main result, we show that our adaptation achieves a linear speedup in terms of the number of peers participating in the network. More precisely, we show that the probability of playing a suboptimal arm at a peer in iteration t = Ω( \log N ) is proportional to 1/(Nt) where N denotes the number of peers. The theoretical results are supported by simulation experiments showing that our algorithm scales gracefully with the size of network."

We present a hierarchical approach which exploits information sharing among different classification tasks, in multi-task and multi-class settings. It engages a top-down iterative method, which begins by posing an optimization problem with an incentive for large scale sharing among all classes. This incentive to share is gradually decreased,until there is no sharing and all tasks are considered separately. The method therefore exploits different levels of sharing within a given group of related tasks, without having to make hard decisions about the grouping of tasks. In order to deal with large scale problems, with many tasks and many classes, we extend our batch approach to an online setting and provide regret analysis of the algorithm. We tested our approach extensively on synthetic and real datasets, showing significant improvement over baseline and state-of-the-art methods."

We present an extensive theoretical analysis in support of our algorithm, including novel multi-class Rademacher complexity margin bounds.

Given a pre- fixed amount of budget, since different tasks have different ambiguities and different workers have different expertises, we want to find an optimal way to allocate the budget among instance-worker pairs such that the overall label quality can be maximized. To address this issue, we start from the simplest setting in which all workers are assumed to be perfect. We formulate the problem as a Bayesian Markov Decision Process (MDP). Using the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, one can obtain the optimal allocation policy for a given budget. However, DP is computationally intractable. To solve the computational challenge, we propose a novel approximate policy which is called optimistic knowledge gradient. It is practically efficient while theoretically its consistency can be guaranteed. We then extend the MDP framework to deal with inhomogeneous workers and tasks with contextual information available. The experiments on both simulated and real data demonstrate the superiority of our method."

The existing graph estimation methods built on Gaussian graphical models and covariance selection algorithms can not handle such data, neither can the theories developed around such methods be directly applied. In this paper, we propose a new principled framework for estimating multi-attribute graphs. Instead of estimating the partial correlation as in current literature, our method estimates the partial canonical correlations that naturally accommodate complex nodal features. Computationally, we provide an efficient algorithm which utilizes the multi-attribute structure. Theoretically, we provide sufficient conditions which guarantee consistent graph recovery. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate performance of our method under various conditions."

However, there is limited research work on which of the two learning scenarios performs better. This paper proposes a novel framework – \emphMultiple Instance LEArning with Global Embedding (MILEAGE), in which the global feature vectors for traditional learning methods are integrated into the MIL setting. MILEAGE can leverage the benefits derived from both learning settings. Within the proposed framework, a large margin method is formulated. In particular, the proposed method adaptively tunes the weights on the two different kinds of feature representations (i.e., global and multiple instance) for each example and trains the classifier simultaneously. An alternative algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting optimization problem, which extends the bundle method to the non-convex case. Some important properties of the proposed method, such as the convergence rate and the generalization error rate, are analyzed. A series of experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art multiple instance and traditional learning methods."

One natural method using convex optimization is to solve the following problem: \min_θ 1\over 2\|Φθ- c\|^2 + λ\|Dθ\|_1. This paper provides an upper bound of the estimate error and shows the consistency property of this method by assuming that the design matrix Φis a Gaussian random matrix. Specifically, we show 1) in the noiseless case, if the condition number of D is bounded and the measurement number n≥Ω(s\log(p)) where s is the sparsity number, then the true solution can be recovered with high probability; and 2) in the noisy case, if the condition number of D is bounded and the measurement increases faster than s\log(p), that is, s\log(p)=o(n), the estimate error converges to zero with probability 1 when p and s go to infinity. Our results are consistent with those for the special case D=\boldI_p\times p (equivalently LASSO) and improve the existing analysis. The condition number of D plays a critical role in our analysis. We consider the condition numbers in two cases including the fused LASSO and the random graph: the condition number in the fused LASSO case is bounded by a constant, while the condition number in the random graph case is bounded with high probability if m\over p (i.e., #\textedge\over #\textvertex) is larger than a certain constant. Numerical simulations are consistent with our theoretical results."

In many practical situations the true pairwise comparisons cannot be actively measured, but a subset of all n(n-1)/2 comparisons is passively and noisily observed. Optimization algorithms (e.g., the SVM) could be used to predict a ranking with fixed expected Kendall tau distance, while achieving an Ω(n) lower bound on the corresponding sample complexity. However, due to their centralized structure they are difficult to extend to online or distributed settings. In this paper we show that much simpler algorithms can match the same Ω(n) lower bound in expectation. Furthermore, if an average of O(n\log(n)) binary comparisons are measured, then one algorithm recovers the true ranking in a uniform sense, while the other predicts the ranking more accurately near the top than the bottom. We discuss extensions to online and distributed ranking, with benefits over traditional alternatives."

Existing work on this problem is restricted to translation invariant kernels only, where (approximate) training features are available explicitly. In fact, for general class of kernel functions and in general setting of releasing different private predictor (\w^*), the problem is impossible to solve \citeCMS11. In this work, we relax the problem setting into three different easier but practical settings. In our first problem setting, we consider an interactive model where the user sends its test set to a trusted learner who sends back differentially private predictions over the test points. This setting is prevalent in modern online systems like search engines, ad engines etc. In the second model, the learner sends back a differentially private version of the optimal parameter vector \w^* but requires access to a small subset of unlabeled test set beforehand. This also is a practical setting that involves two parties interacting through trusted third party. Our third model is similar to the traditional model, where learner is oblivious to the test set and needs to send a differentially private version of \w^*, but the kernels are restricted to efficiently computable functions over low-dimensional vector spaces. For each of the models, we derive differentially private learning algorithms with provable “utlity” or error bounds. Moreover, we show that our methods can also be applied to the traditional setting of \cite Rubinstein09, CMS11. Here, our sample complexity bounds have only O(d^1/3) dependence on the dimensionality d while existing methods require O(d^1/2) samples to achieve same generalization error."

It is a randomized algorithm based on Bayesian ideas, and has recently generated significant interest after several studies demonstrated it to have better empirical performance compared to the state of the art methods. However, many questions regarding its theoretical performance remained open. In this paper, we design and analyze Thompson Sampling algorithm for the stochastic contextual multi-armed bandit problem with linear payoff functions, when the contexts are provided by an adaptive adversary. This is among the most important and widely studied version of the contextual bandits problem. We prove a high probability regret bound of \tildeO(\fracd\sqrtε\sqrtT^1+ε) in time T for any ε∈(0,1), where d is the dimension of each context vector and εis a parameter used by the algorithm. Our results provide the first theoretical guarantees for the contextual version of Thompson Sampling, and are close to the lower bound of Ω(\sqrtdT) for this problem. This essentially solves the COLT open problem of Chapelle and Li [COLT 2012] regarding regret bounds for Thompson Sampling for contextual bandits problem with linear payoff functions. Our version of Thompson sampling uses Gaussian prior and Gaussian likelihood function. Our novel martingale-based analysis techniques also allow easy extensions to the use of other distributions, satisfying certain general conditions."

One of the difficulties of this problem is that in the measurement space, behaviors can be very mixed, despite existing a latent representation where they can be easily separated. We propose a mixture model based on Dirichlet Process (DP) to simultaneously cluster the observed time-series and recover a sparse representation of the behaviors using a Laplacian prior as the base measure of the DP. We show that for linear models, e.g potential functions generated by linear combinations of a large number of features, it is possible to compute analytically the marginal of the observations and derive an efficient sampler. The method is evaluated using robot behaviors and real data from human motion and compared to other techniques."

In this model the energy of a string (labeling) x_1\ldots x_n is the sum of terms over intervals [i,j] where each term is non-zero only if the substring x_i\ldots x_j equals a prespecified pattern α. Such CRFs can be naturally applied to many sequence tagging problems. We present efficient algorithms for the three standard inference tasks in a CRF, namely computing (i) the partition function, (ii) marginals, and (iii) computing the MAP. Their complexities are respectively O(n L), O(n L \ell_\max) and O(n L \min{|D|,\log (\ell_\max + 1)}) where L is the combined length of input patterns, \ell_\max is the maximum length of a pattern, and D is the input alphabet. This improves on the previous algorithms of \citeYe:NIPS09 whose complexities are respectively O(n L |D|), O\left(n |Γ| L^2 \ell_\max^2\right) and O(n L |D|), where |Γ| is the number of input patterns.

This is an important problem in the signal acquisition area and has several learning applications as well, e.g., multi-label classification \citeHsuKLZ10. We study this problem in two settings: a) support recovery: recover \supp(\x^*), b) approximate vector recovery: recover a unit vector \hx s.t. || \hatx-\x^*/||\x^*|| ||_2≤ε. For support recovery, we propose two novel and efficient solutions based on two combinatorial structures: union free family of sets and expanders. In contrast to existing methods for support recovery, our methods are universal i.e. a single measurement matrix A can recover almost all the signals. For approximate recovery, we propose the first method to recover sparse vector using a near optimal number of measurements. We also empirically demonstrate effectiveness of our algorithms; we show that our algorithms are able to recover signals with smaller number of measurements than several existing methods."

Handling cycles efficiently would greatly enhance our ability to tackle general MRFs. In particular, for dual decomposition of energy minimization (MAP inference), using cycle subproblems leads to a much tighter relaxation than using trees, but solving the cycle subproblems turns out to be the bottleneck. In this paper, we present a fast and exact algorithm for energy minimization in cycle MRFs, which can be used as a subroutine in tackling general MRFs. Our method builds on junction-tree message passing, with a large portion of the message entries pruned for efficiency. The pruning conditions fully exploit the structure of a cycle. Experimental results show that our algorithm is more than an order of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art fast inference methods, and it performs consistently well in several different real problems."

A key assumption built into the model is that each point stochastically selects a single neighbor, which makes the model well-justified only for kNN with k=1. However, kNN classifiers with k>1 are more robust and usually preferred in practice. Here we present kNCA, which generalizes NCA by learning distance metrics that are appropriate for kNN with arbitrary k. The main technical contribution is showing how to efficiently compute and optimize the expected accuracy of a kNN classifier. We apply similar ideas in an unsupervised setting to yield kSNE and ktSNE, generalizations of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE, tSNE) that operate on neighborhoods of size k, which provide an axis of control over embeddings that allow for more homogeneous and interpretable regions. Empirically, we show that kNCA often improves classification accuracy over state of the art methods, produces qualitative differences in the embeddings as k is varied, and is more robust with respect to label noise."

One of the current most effective class of methods to do so is based on non-negative matrix factorization and related latent variable models. Such techniques, however, typically perform poorly when no isolated training data is given and do not allow user feedback to correct for poor results. To overcome these issues, we allow a user to interactively constrain a latent variable model by painting on a time-frequency display of sound to guide the learning process. The annotations are used within the framework of posterior regularization to impose linear grouping constraints that would otherwise be difficult to achieve via standard priors. For the constraints considered, an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm is derived with closed-form multiplicative updates, drawing connections to non-negative matrix factorization methods, and allowing for high-quality interactive-rate separation without explicit training data."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/lopes13.pdf,Estimating Unknown Sparsity in Compressed Sensing,Miles Lopes,"In the theory of compressed sensing (CS), the sparsity \|x\|_0 of the unknown signal x∈\R^p is commonly assumed to be a known parameter. However, it is typically unknown in practice. Due to the fact that many aspects of CS depend on knowing \|x\|_0, it is important to estimate this parameter in a data-driven way. A second practical concern is that \|x\|_0 is a highly unstable function of x. In particular, for real signals with entries not exactly equal to 0, the value \|x\|_0=p is not a useful description of the effective number of coordinates. In this paper, we propose to estimate a stable measure of sparsity s(x):=\|x\|_1^2/\|x\|_2^2, which is a sharp lower bound on \|x\|_0. Our estimation procedure uses only a small number of linear measurements, does not rely on any sparsity assumptions, and requires very little computation. A confidence interval for s(x) is provided, and its width is shown to have no dependence on the signal dimension p. Moreover, this result extends naturally to the matrix recovery setting, where a soft version of matrix rank can be estimated with analogous guarantees. Finally, we show that the use of randomized measurements is essential to estimating s(x). This is accomplished by proving that the minimax risk for estimating s(x) with deterministic measurements is large when n≪p."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/broderick13.pdf,MAD-Bayes: MAP-based Asymptotic Derivations from Bayes,"Tamara Broderick, Brian Kulis, Michael Jordan","The classical mixture of Gaussians model is related to K-means via small-variance asymptotics: as the covariances of the Gaussians tend to zero, the negative log-likelihood of the mixture of Gaussians model approaches the K-means objective, and the EM algorithm approaches the K-means algorithm. Kulis & Jordan (2012) used this observation to obtain a novel K-means-like algorithm from a Gibbs sampler for the Dirichlet process (DP) mixture. We instead consider applying small-variance asymptotics directly to the posterior in Bayesian nonparametric models. This framework is independent of any specific Bayesian inference algorithm, and it has the major advantage that it generalizes immediately to a range of models beyond the DP mixture. To illustrate, we apply our framework to the feature learning setting, where the beta process and Indian buffet process provide an appropriate Bayesian nonparametric prior. We obtain a novel objective function that goes beyond clustering to learn (and penalize new) groupings for which we relax the mutual exclusivity and exhaustivity assumptions of clustering. We demonstrate several other algorithms, all of which are scalable and simple to implement. Empirical results demonstrate the benefits of the new framework."

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of hybrid generative-discriminative learning for Bayesian networks. We use an SVM-type large margin formulation for discriminative training, introducing a likelihood-weighted \ell^1-norm for the SVM-norm-penalization. This simultaneously optimizes the data likelihood and therefore partly maintains the generative character of the model. For many network structures, our method can be formulated as a convex problem, guaranteeing a globally optimal solution. In terms of classification, the resulting models outperform state-of-the art generative and discriminative learning methods for Bayesian networks, and are comparable with linear and kernelized SVMs. Furthermore, the models achieve likelihoods close to the maximum likelihood solution and show robust behavior in classification experiments with missing features."

This paper proposes an improvement to random kitchen sinks that offers significantly faster computation in log-linear time without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, we show how one may adjust the regularization properties of the kernel simply by changing the spectral distribution of the projection matrix. We provide experimental results which show that even for for moderately small problems we already achieve two orders of magnitude faster computation and three orders of magnitude lower memory footprint."

Transfer learning addresses this problem by using the knowledge gained from a related and already labeled data source, whereas active learning focuses on selecting a small set of informative samples for manual annotation. Recently, there has been much interest in developing frameworks that combine both transfer and active learning methodologies. A few such frameworks reported in literature perform transfer and active learning in two separate stages. In this work, we present an integrated framework that performs transfer and active learning simultaneously by solving a single convex optimization problem. The proposed framework computes the weights of source domain data and selects the samples from the target domain data simultaneously, by minimizing a common objective of reducing distribution difference between the data set consisting of reweighted source and the queried target domain data and the set of unlabeled target domain data. Comprehensive experiments on three real world data sets demonstrate that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy by 5% to 10% over the existing two-stage approach"
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/qi13.pdf,Message passing with l1 penalized KL minimization,"Yuan Qi, Yandong Guo","Bayesian inference is often hampered by large computational expense. As a generalization of belief propagation (BP), expectation propagation (EP) approximates exact Bayesian computation with efficient message passing updates. However, when an approximation family used by EP is far from exact posterior distributions, message passing may lead to poor approximation quality and suffer from divergence. To address this issue, we propose an approximate inference method, relaxed expectation propagation(REP), based on a new divergence with a l1 penalty. Minimizing this penalized divergence adaptively relaxes EP’s moment matching requirement for message passing. We apply REP to Gaussian process classification and experimental results demonstrate significant improvement of REP over EP and alpha-divergence based power EP – in terms of algorithmic stability, estimation accuracy, and predictive performance. Furthermore, we develop relaxed belief propagation(RBP), a special case of REP, to conduct inference on discrete Markov random fields (MRFs). Our results show improved estimation accuracy of RBP over BP and fractional BP when interactions between MRF nodes are strong."

We show that many of the optimization problems arising in this context can be solved exactly using semidefinite programming and some variant of the \mathcalS-lemma. In finance, these methods are used to isolate statistical arbitrage opportunities, i.e. mean reverting portfolios with enough variance to overcome market friction. In a more general setting, mean reversion and its generalizations are also used as a proxy for stationarity, while variance simply measures signal strength."

Unlike classic decision tree learning algorithms like ID3, C4.5 and CART, which work in a top-down manner, existing Bayesian algorithms produce an approximation to the posterior distribution by evolving a complete tree (or collection thereof) iteratively via local Monte Carlo modifications to the structure of the tree, e.g., using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We present a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that instead works in a top-down manner, mimicking the behavior and speed of classic algorithms. We demonstrate empirically that our approach delivers accuracy comparable to the most popular MCMC method, but operates more than an order of magnitude faster, and thus represents a better computation-accuracy tradeoff."

The proposed approach provides a flexible framework for incorporating feature similarity or temporal information present in data sets, via nonparametric kernel smoothing. We provide generalization bounds for dictionary learning using smooth sparse coding and show how the sample complexity depends on the L1 norm of kernel function used. Furthermore, we propose using marginal regression for obtaining sparse codes, which significantly improves the speed and allows one to scale to large dictionary sizes easily. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach, both in terms of accuracy and speed by extensive experimentation on several real data sets. In addition, we demonstrate how the proposed approach could be used for improving semisupervised sparse coding."

The former requires unlabeled images from the same distribution as the labeled ones and the latter leverages labeled images from related homogenous tasks. However, these restrictions often cannot be satisfied. To address this, we propose a novel robust and discriminative self-taught learning approach to utilize any unlabeled data without the above restrictions. Our new approach employs a robust loss function to learn the dictionary, and enforces the structured sparse regularization to automatically select the optimal dictionary basis vectors and incorporate the supervision information contained in the labeled data. We derive an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the optimization problem and rigorously prove its convergence. Promising results in extensive experiments have validated the proposed approach."

When either the policy evaluation step or the policy improvement step returns an approximated result, the sequence of policies produced by policy iteration may not be monotonically increasing, and oscillations may occur. To address this issue, we consider safe policy improvements, i.e., at each iteration we search for a policy that maximizes a lower bound to the policy improvement w.r.t. the current policy. When no improving policy can be found the algorithm stops. We propose two safe policy-iteration algorithms that differ in the way the next policy is chosen w.r.t. the estimated greedy policy. Besides being theoretically derived and discussed, the proposed algorithms are empirically evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art approaches on some chain-walk domains and on the Blackjack card game."

Existing approaches for discovering latent structures often require the unknown number of hidden states as an input. In this paper, we propose a quartet based approach which is agnostic to this number. The key contribution is a novel rank characterization of the tensor associated with the marginal distribution of a quartet. This characterization allows us to design a nuclear norm based test for resolving quartet relations. We then use the quartet test as a subroutine in a divide-and-conquer algorithm for recovering the latent tree structure. Under mild conditions, the algorithm is consistent and its error probability decays exponentially with increasing sample size. We demonstrate that the proposed approach compares favorably to alternatives. In a real world stock dataset, it also discovers meaningful groupings of variables, and produces a model that fits the data better."

We formulate fairness as an optimization problem of finding a good representation of the data with two competing goals: to encode the data as well as possible, while simultaneously obfuscating any information about membership in the protected group. We show positive results of our algorithm relative to other known techniques, on three datasets. Moreover, we demonstrate several advantages to our approach. First, our intermediate representation can be used for other classification tasks (i.e., transfer learning is possible); secondly, we take a step toward learning a distance metric which can find important dimensions of the data for classification."

In this new view, the marginal probability table of the observed variables in a latent tree is treated as a tensor, and we show that: (i) the latent variables induce low rank structures in various matricizations of the tensor; (ii) this collection of low rank matricizations induce a hierarchical low rank decomposition of the tensor. Exploiting these properties, we derive an optimization problem for estimating the parameters of a latent tree graphical model, i.e., hierarchical decomposion of a tensor which minimizes the Frobenius norm of the difference between the original tensor and its decomposition. When the latent tree graphical models are correctly specified, we show that a global optimum of the optimization problem can be obtained via a recursive decomposition algorithm. This algorithm recovers previous spectral algorithms for hidden Markov models (Hsu et al., 2009; Foster et al., 2012) and latent tree graphical models (Parikh et al., 2011; Song et al., 2011) as special cases, elucidating the global objective these algorithms are optimizing for. When the latent tree graphical models are misspecified, we derive a better decomposition based on our framework, and provide approximation guarantee for this new estimator. In both synthetic and real world data, this new estimator significantly improves over the-state-of-the-art."

We propose a method to automatically adjust multiple learning rates so as to minimize the expected error at any one time. The method relies on local gradient variations across samples. In our approach, learning rates can increase as well as decrease, making it suitable for non-stationary problems. Using a number of convex and non-convex learning tasks, we show that the resulting algorithm matches the performance of the best settings obtained through systematic search, and effectively removes the need for learning rate tuning."

Most previous studies employ kernels or graphs to integrate different types of features, which routinely assume one weight for one type of features. However, for many problems, the importance of features in one source to an individual cluster of data can be varied, which makes the previous approaches ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view learning model to integrate all features and learn the weight for every feature with respect to each cluster individually via new joint structured sparsity-inducing norms. The proposed multi-view learning framework allows us not only to perform clustering tasks, but also to deal with classification tasks by an extension when the labeling knowledge is available. A new efficient algorithm is derived to solve the formulated objective with rigorous theoretical proof on its convergence. We applied our new data fusion method to five broadly used multi-view data sets for both clustering and classification. In all experimental results, our method clearly outperforms other related state-of-the-art methods."

Traditionally, the main planning operation is a full backup based on the current estimates of the successor states. Consequently, its computation time is proportional to the number of successor states. In this paper, we introduce a new planning backup that uses only the current value of a single successor state and has a computation time independent of the number of successor states. This new backup, which we call a small backup, opens the door to a new class of model-based reinforcement learning methods that exhibit much finer control over their planning process than traditional methods. We empirically demonstrate that this increased flexibility allows for more efficient planning by showing that an implementation of prioritized sweeping based on small backups achieves a substantial performance improvement over classical implementations."

However, most applications have a continuous and thus uncountably infinite state space. We propose the novel concept of learning a discrete representation of the continuous state space to solve the integrals in continuous POMDPs efficiently and generalize sparse calculations over the continuous space. The representation is iteratively refined as part of a novel Value Iteration step and does not depend on prior knowledge. Consistency for the learned generalization is asserted by a self-correction algorithm. The presented concept is implemented for continuous state and observation spaces based on Monte Carlo approximation to allow for arbitrary POMDP models. In an experimental comparison it yields higher values in significantly shorter time than state of the art algorithms and solves higher-dimensional problems."

This constitutes a major obstacle in applying these methods in several frameworks, such as time series, random fields, inverse problems, for which noise is rarely homoscedastic and the noise level is hard to know in advance. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the joint estimation of the conditional mean and the conditional variance in a high-dimensional (auto-) regression setting. An attractive feature of the proposed estimator is that it is efficiently computable even for very large scale problems by solving a second-order cone program (SOCP). We present theoretical analysis and numerical results assessing the performance of the proposed procedure."

A general principle to solve the problem is to make the training data distribution similar to the test one, such that classifiers computed on the former generalizes well to the latter. Current approaches typically target on the sample distribution in the input space, however, for kernel-based learning methods, the algorithm performance depends directly on the geometry of the kernel-induced feature space. Motivated by this, we propose to match data distributions in the Hilbert space, which, given a pre-defined empirical kernel map, can be formulated as aligning kernel matrices across domains. In particular, to evaluate similarity of kernel matrices defined on arbitrarily different samples, the novel concept of surrogate kernel is introduced based on the Mercer's theorem. Our approach caters the model adaptation specifically to kernel-based learning mechanism, and demonstrates promising results on several real-world applications."

In particular, we develop a method with better theoretical guarantee compared to all previous work, both in terms of the clustering accuracy and the conductance of the output set. We also prove that our analysis is tight, and perform empirical evaluation to support our theory on both synthetic and real data. More specifically, our method outperforms prior work when the cluster is WELL-CONNECTED. In fact, the better it is well-connected inside, the more significant improvement we can obtain. Our results shed light on why in practice some random-walk-based algorithms perform better than its previous theory, and help guide future research about local clustering."

However, in many real-world applications, the number of class labels can be in the hundreds or even thousands, and existing multi-label classification methods often become computationally inefficient. In recent years, a number of remedies have been proposed. However, they are either based on simple dimension reduction techniques or involve expensive optimization problems. In this paper, we address this problem by selecting a small subset of class labels that can approximately span the original label space. This is performed by randomized sampling where the sampling probability of each class label reflects its importance among all the labels. Theoretical analysis shows that this randomized sampling approach is highly efficient. Experiments on a number of real-world multi-label datasets with many labels demonstrate the appealing performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/chen13g.pdf,Spectral Compressed Sensing via Structured Matrix Completion,"Yuxin Chen, Yuejie Chi","The paper studies the problem of recovering a spectrally sparse object from a small number of time domain samples. Specifically, the object of interest with ambient dimension n is assumed to be a mixture of r complex multi-dimensional sinusoids, while the underlying frequencies can assume any value in the unit disk. Conventional compressed sensing paradigms suffer from the \em basis mismatch issue when imposing a discrete dictionary on the Fourier representation. To address this problem, we develop a novel nonparametric algorithm, called enhanced matrix completion (EMaC), based on structured matrix completion. The algorithm starts by converting the data into a low-rank enhanced form with multi-fold Hankel structure, then attempts recovery via nuclear norm minimization. Under mild incoherence conditions, EMaC allows perfect recovery as soon as the number of samples exceeds the order of \mathcalO(r\log^2 n). We also show that, in many instances, accurate completion of a low-rank multi-fold Hankel matrix is possible when the number of observed entries is proportional to the information theoretical limits (except for a logarithmic gap). The robustness of EMaC against bounded noise and its applicability to super resolution are further demonstrated by numerical experiments."

In particular, we first introduce the Matrix Generalized Inverse Gaussian (MGIG) prior and define a Gaussian Matrix Generalized Inverse Gaussian (GMGIG) model for low-rank approximation to the task covariance matrix. Through combining the GMGIG model with the residual error structure assumption, we propose the GMGIG regression model for multi-task learning. To make the computation tractable, we simultaneously use variational inference and sampling techniques. In particular, we propose two sampling strategies for computing the statistics of the MGIG distribution. Experiments show that this model is superior to the peer methods in regression and prediction."

(2012) and Xie et al. (2012) proposed to use a denoising autoencoder (DAE) for denoising noisy images. They showed that a plain, deep DAE can denoise noisy images as well as the conventional methods such as BM3D and KSVD. Both of them approached image denoising by denoising small, image patches of a larger image and combining them to form a clean image. In this setting, it is usual to use the encoder of the DAE to obtain the latent representation and subsequently apply the decoder to get the clean patch. We propose that a simple sparsification of the latent representation found by the encoder improves denoising performance, when the DAE was trained with sparsity regularization. The experiments confirm that the proposed sparsification indeed helps both denoising a small image patch and denoising a larger image consisting of those patches. Furthermore, it is found out that the proposed method improves even classification performance when test samples are corrupted with noise."

We present a generic decoupling technique that enables us to provide Rademacher complexity-based generalization error bounds. Our bounds are in general tighter than those obtained by Wang et al. (COLT 2012) for the same problem. Using our decoupling technique, we are further able to obtain fast convergence rates for strongly con-vex pairwise loss functions. We are also able to analyze a class of memory efficient on-line learning algorithms for pairwise learning problems that use only a bounded subset of past training samples to update the hypothesis at each step. Finally, in order to complement our generalization bounds, we propose a novel memory efficient online learning algorithm for higher order learning problems with bounded regret guarantees."

However, the commonly-used dimensionality reduction techniques fail to account for the fact that only part of the signal is shared across all the videos in one class. As a consequence, the resulting representations contain instance-specific information, which introduces noise in the classification process. In this paper, we introduce Non-Linear Stationary Subspace Analysis: A method that overcomes this issue by explicitly separating the stationary parts of the video signal (i.e., the parts shared across all videos in one class), from its non-stationary parts (i.e., specific to individual videos).

Our data structure, which shares some similarity with Bregman Ball Trees, consists of a hierarchical partition of a database, and uses a novel branch and bound methodology for search. The main technical contribution of the paper is a novel and efficient algorithm for deciding whether to explore nodes during backtracking, based on a variational approximation. This reduces the number of computations per node, and overcomes the limitations of Bregman Ball Trees on high dimensional data. In addition, our strategy is applicable also to probability distributions with hidden state variables, and is not limited to regular exponential family distributions. Experiments demonstrate substantial speed-ups over both Bregman Ball Trees and over brute force search, on both moderate and high dimensional histogram data. In addition, experiments on linear dynamical systems demonstrate the flexibility of our approach to latent variable models."

Hinton and Roweis (2003) introduced a way to set the scale individually for each point so that it has a distribution over neighbors with a desired perplexity, or effective number of neighbors. This gives very good affinities that adapt locally to the data but are harder to compute. We study the mathematical properties of these “entropic affinities” and show that they implicitly define a continuously differentiable function in the input space and give bounds for it. We then devise a fast algorithm to compute the widths and affinities, based on robustified, quickly convergent root-finding methods combined with a tree- or density-based initialization scheme that exploits the slowly-varying behavior of this function. This algorithm is nearly optimal and much more accurate and fast than the existing bisection-based approach, particularly with large datasets, as we show with image and text data."

We generalize Localized Multiple Kernel Learning so as to learn a primal feature space embedding which is high dimensional, sparse and computationally deep. Primal based classification decouples prediction costs from the number of support vectors and our tree-structured features efficiently encode non-linearities while speeding up prediction exponentially over the state-of-the-art. We develop routines for optimizing over the space of tree-structured features and efficiently scale to problems with over half a million training points. Experiments on benchmark data sets reveal that our formulation can reduce prediction costs by more than three orders of magnitude in some cases with a moderate sacrifice in classification accuracy as compared to RBF-SVMs. Furthermore, our formulation leads to much better classification accuracies over leading methods."

Unlike the existing works, our approach avoids making restrictive assumptions about the data. The \proptoSVM model leads to a non-convex integer programming problem.

It has recently been shown that mean field inference in dense random fields can be performed efficiently and that these models enable significant accuracy gains in computer vision applications. However, parameter estimation for dense random fields is still poorly understood. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for learning parameters in dense random fields. All parameters are estimated jointly, thus capturing dependencies between them. We show that gradients of a variety of loss functions over the mean field marginals can be computed efficiently. The resulting algorithm learns parameters that directly optimize the performance of mean field inference in the model. As a supporting result, we present an efficient inference algorithm for dense random fields that is guaranteed to converge."

In this work, we describe a scalable simple random sampling algorithm, named ScaSRS, which uses probabilistic thresholds to decide on the fly whether to accept, reject, or wait-list an item independently of others. We prove, with high probability, it succeeds and needs only O(\sqrtk) storage, where k is the sample size. ScaSRS extends naturally to a scalable stratified sampling algorithm, which is favorable for heterogeneous data sets.

We tackle this problem in a Riemannian optimization framework. In particular, we consider its applications in pairwise-based action recognition, and cross-domain image-based object recognition. In both applications, the proposed algorithm produces competitive performance on respective benchmark datasets."

In this paper we analyze the classification accuracy with respect to dictionary size by linking the encoding stage to kernel methods and \nystrom sampling, and obtain useful bounds on accuracy as a function of size. The \nystrom method also inspires us to revisit dictionary learning from local patches, and we propose to learn the dictionary in an end-to-end fashion taking into account pooling, a common computational layer in vision. We validate our contribution by showing how the derived bounds are able to explain the observed behavior of multiple datasets, and show that the pooling aware method efficiently reduces the dictionary size by a factor of two for a given accuracy."

However, some of the most popular models suffer from a) overfitting problems and multiple local optima, b) failure to capture shifts in market conditions and c) large computational costs. To address these problems we introduce a novel dynamic model for time-changing covariances. Over-fitting and local optima are avoided by following a Bayesian approach instead of computing point estimates. Changes in market conditions are captured by assuming a diffusion process in parameter values, and finally computationally efficient and scalable inference is performed using particle filters. Experiments with financial data show excellent performance of the proposed method with respect to current standard models."

Our main results consist of an empirical evaluation of the performance quality and running time of sampling and projection methods on a diverse suite of SPSD matrices. Our results highlight complementary aspects of sampling versus projection methods, and they point to differences between uniform and nonuniform sampling methods based on leverage scores. We complement our empirical results with a suite of worst-case theoretical bounds for both random sampling and random projection methods. These bounds are qualitatively superior to existing bounds— e.g., improved additive-error bounds for spectral and Frobenius norm error and relative-error bounds for trace norm error."

PSDTF can be viewed as a natural extension of nonnegative matrix factorization. One of the main problems of PSDTF is that an appropriate number of bases should be given in advance. To solve this problem, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian model based on a gamma process that can instantiate only a limited number of necessary bases from the infinitely many bases assumed to exist. We derive a variational Bayesian algorithm for closed-form posterior inference and a multiplicative update rule for maximum-likelihood estimation. We evaluated PSDTF on both synthetic data and real music recordings to show its superiority."

This provides a robustness interpretation of these widely applied Lasso-like algorithms, and allows us to construct novel generalizations of Lasso-like algorithms by considering different uncertainty sets. Using this robustness interpretation, we present new sparsity results, and establish the statistical consistency of the proposed regularized linear regression. This work extends a classical result from Xu et al. (2010) that relates standard Lasso with robust linear regression to learning problems with more general sparse-like structures, and provides new robustness-based tools to to understand learning problems with sparse-like structures."

While exhibiting fast speeds at test time, relatively slow training makes them impractical for applications with real-time learning requirements. We propose a principled approach to overcome this drawback. We prove a bound on the error of a decision stump given its preliminary error on a subset of the training data; the bound may be used to prune unpromising features early on in the training process. We propose a fast training algorithm that exploits this bound, yielding speedups of an order of magnitude at no cost in the final performance of the classifier. Our method is not a new variant of Boosting; rather, it may be used in conjunction with existing Boosting algorithms and other sampling heuristics to achieve even greater speedups."

It is well known that the usual misclassification error is ill-suited for measuring performance in such settings. A wide range of performance measures have been proposed for this problem, in machine learning as well as in data mining, artificial intelligence, and various applied fields. However, despite the large number of studies on this problem, little is understood about the statistical consistency of the algorithms proposed with respect to the performance measures of interest. In this paper, we study consistency with respect to one such performance measure, namely the arithmetic mean of the true positive and true negative rates (AM), and establish that some simple methods that have been used in practice, such as applying an empirically determined threshold to a suitable class probability estimate or performing an empirically balanced form of risk minimization, are in fact consistent with respect to the AM (under mild conditions on the underlying distribution). Our results employ balanced losses that have been used recently in analyses of ranking problems (Kotlowski et al., 2011) and build on recent results on consistent surrogates for cost-sensitive losses (Scott, 2012). Experimental results confirm our consistency theorems."

We introduce a framework to support large-scale assessment of topical relevance. We measure the correspondence between a set of latent topics and a set of reference concepts to quantify four types of topical misalignment: junk, fused, missing, and repeated topics. Our analysis compares 10,000 topic model variants to 200 expert-provided domain concepts, and demonstrates how our framework can inform choices of model parameters, inference algorithms, and intrinsic measures of topical quality."

Although many online learning algorithms have been proposed to learn a sparse kernel classifier, most of them fail to bound the number of support vectors used by the final solution which is the average of the intermediate kernel classifiers generated by online algorithms. The key idea of the proposed algorithm is to measure the difficulty in correctly classifying a training example by the derivative of a smooth loss function, and give a more chance to a difficult example to be a support vector than an easy one via a sampling scheme. Our analysis shows that when the loss function is smooth, the proposed algorithm yields similar performance guarantee as the standard online learning algorithm but with a near optimal number of support vectors (up to a poly(lnT) factor). Our empirical study shows promising performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms for online sparse kernel learning."

This is motivated by the fact that static, orderless snapshots are usually easier to obtain than time series in quite a few dynamic modeling tasks. Building on existing spectral learning algorithms, our methods solve convex optimization problems minimizing squared loss on the dynamic data plus a regularization term on the static data. Experiments on synthetic and real human activities data demonstrate better prediction by the proposed method than existing spectral algorithms."

However, existing techniques focus on preserving the semantic distances between classes (e.g., according to a given object taxonomy for visual recognition), limiting the influence to pairwise structures. We propose to model \emphanalogies that reflect the relationships between multiple pairs of classes simultaneously, in the form “p is to q, as r is to s"""". We translate semantic analogies into higher-order geometric constraints called \emphanalogical parallelograms, and use them in a novel convex regularizer for a discriminatively learned label embedding. Furthermore, we show how to discover analogies from attribute-based class descriptions, and how to prioritize those likely to reduce inter-class confusion. Evaluating our Analogy-preserving Semantic Embedding (ASE) on two visual recognition datasets, we demonstrate clear improvements over existing approaches, both in terms of recognition accuracy and analogy completion."

To use these algorithms on a classification model, we must show that the model has appropriate algebraic structure. It is easy to give algebraic structure to some models, and we do this explicitly for Bayesian classifiers and a novel variation of decision stumps called HomStumps. But not all classifiers have an obvious structure, so we introduce the Free HomTrainer. This can be used to give a “generic” algebraic structure to any classifier. We use the Free HomTrainer to give algebraic structure to bagging and boosting. In so doing, we derive novel online and parallel algorithms, and present the first fast cross-validation schemes for these classifiers."

However, for real-world data, it is usually difficult to assess the task relatedness and joint learning with unrelated tasks may lead to serious performance degradations. To this end, we propose a framework that groups the tasks based on their relatedness in a low dimensional subspace and allows a varying degree of relatedness among tasks by sharing the subspace bases across the groups. This provides the flexibility of no sharing when two sets of tasks are unrelated and partial/total sharing when the tasks are related. Importantly, the number of task-groups and the subspace dimensionality are automatically inferred from the data. This feature keeps the model beyond a specific set of parameters. To realize our framework, we present a novel Bayesian nonparametric prior that extends the traditional hierarchical beta process prior using a Dirichlet process to permit potentially infinite number of child beta processes. We apply our model for multi-task regression and classification applications. Experimental results using several synthetic and real-world datasets show the superiority of our model to other recent state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods."

Many times networks over which contagions diffuse are unobserved and need to be inferred. Here we apply survival theory to develop general additive and multiplicative risk models under which the network inference problems can be solved efficiently by exploiting their convexity. Our additive risk model generalizes several existing network inference models. We show all these models are particular cases of our more general model. Our multiplicative model allows for modeling scenarios in which a node can either increase or decrease the risk of activation of another node, in contrast with previous approaches, which consider only positive risk increments. We evaluate the performance of our network inference algorithms on large synthetic and real cascade datasets, and show that our models are able to predict the length and duration of cascades in real data."

The advantage is that we only require a prior distribution on a class of simulators. This is useful when a probabilistic model of the underlying process is too complex to formulate, but where detailed simulation models are available. ABC-RL allows the use of any Bayesian reinforcement learning technique in this case. It can be seen as an extension of simulation methods to both planning and inference. We experimentally demonstrate the potential of this approach in a comparison with LSPI. Finally, we introduce a theorem showing that ABC is sound."

We make no restrictive assumptions (such as sparsity or separability) on the data: Instead we use the fact that, in a classification setting, the question of interest is really ‘what is the effect of random projection on the predicted class labels?’ and we therefore derive the exact probability of ‘label flipping’ under Gaussian random projection in order to quantify this effect precisely in our bounds."

This is done by \em decoupling the learning task into two steps: first estimating the output parameters, and then estimating the hidden states transition probabilities. The first step is accomplished by fitting a mixture model to the output stationary distribution. Given the parameters of this mixture model, the second step is formulated as the solution of an easily solvable convex quadratic program. We provide an error analysis for the estimated transition probabilities and show they are robust to small perturbations in the estimates of the mixture parameters.

Here we extend the LDA model to deal with documents that are represented more naturally by bags of continuous descriptors. Given a finite dictionary of words which are generative models of descriptors, our extended LDA model allows for the soft assignment of descriptors to (many) dictionary words. We derive variational inference and parameter estimation procedures for the extended model, which closely resemble those obtained for the original model, with two important differences: First, the histogram of word counts is replaced by a histogram of pseudo word counts, or sums of responsibilities over all descriptors. Second, parameter estimation now depends on the average covariance matrix between these pseudo-counts, reflecting the fact that with soft assignment words are not independent. We use this approach to address novelty detection, where we seek to identify video events with low posterior probability. Video events are described by a generative dynamic texture model, from which we naturally derive a dictionary of generative words. Using a benchmark dataset for novelty detection, we show a very significant improvement in the detection of novel events when using our extended LDA model with soft assignment to words as against hard assignment (the original model), achieving state of the art novelty detection results."

Recent work has shown how certain autoencoders can assign an unnormalized “score” to data which measures how well the autoencoder can represent the data. Scores are commonly computed by using training criteria that relate the autoencoder to a probabilistic model, such as the Restricted Boltzmann Machine. In this paper we show how an autoencoder can assign meaningful scores to data independently of training procedure and without reference to any probabilistic model, by interpreting it as a dynamical system. We discuss how, and under which conditions, running the dynamical system can be viewed as performing gradient descent in an energy function, which in turn allows us to derive a score via integration. We also show how one can combine multiple, unnormalized scores into a generative classifier."

The proposed model postulates a set of (theoretically) infinite interdependent large-margin classifiers as model components, that robustly capture local nonlinearity of complex data. The postulated large-margin classifiers are connected in the context of a Markov-switching construction that allows for capturing complex temporal dynamics in the modeled datasets. Appropriate stick-breaking priors are imposed over the component switching mechanism of our model to allow for data-driven determination of the optimal number of component large-margin classifiers, under a standard nonparametric Bayesian inference scheme. Efficient model training is performed under the maximum entropy discrimination (MED) framework, which integrates the large-margin principle with Bayesian posterior inference. We evaluate our method using several real-world datasets, and compare it to state-of-the-art alternatives."

It relies on a novel distribution pseudodistance based on a disagreement averaging. Using this measure, we derive a PAC-Bayesian DA bound for the stochastic Gibbs classifier. This bound has the advantage of being directly optimizable for any hypothesis space. We specialize it to linear classifiers, and design a learning algorithm which shows interesting results on a synthetic problem and on a popular sentiment annotation task. This opens the door to tackling DA tasks by making use of all the PAC-Bayesian tools."

Our algorithm is combinatorial and operates by examining a discrete set of special vectors lying in a low-dimensional eigen-subspace of A. We obtain provable approximation guarantees that depend on the spectral profile of the matrix: the faster the eigenvalue decay, the better the quality of our approximation. For example, if the eigenvalues of A follow a power-law decay, we obtain a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for any desired accuracy. We implement our algorithm and test it on multiple artificial and real data sets. Due to a feature elimination step, it is possible to perform sparse PCA on data sets consisting of millions of entries in a few minutes. Our experimental evaluation shows that our scheme is nearly optimal while finding very sparse vectors. We compare to the prior state of the art and show that our scheme matches or outperforms previous algorithms in all tested data sets."

The estimators are based on hard thresholding of the sample covariance matrix entries together with l2-regularizion(ridge regression). We analyze the predictive risk of this family of estimators as a function of the threshold and regularization parameter. With appropriate parameter choices, the estimate is the solution to a sparse, diagonally dominant linear system, solvable in near-linear time. Our analysis shows how the risk varies with the sparsity and regularization level, thus establishing a statistical estimation setting for which there is an explicit, smooth tradeoff between risk and computation. Simulations are provided to support the theoretical analyses."

We derive results for exact rule recovery which parallel the conditions for exact recovery of sparse signals in the compressed sensing literature: although the general rule recovery problem is NP-hard, under some conditions on the Boolean ‘sensing’ matrix, the rule can be recovered exactly. This is an exciting development in rule learning where most prior work focused on heuristic solutions. Furthermore we construct rule sets from these learned clauses using set covering and boosting.

We are interested in understanding how many corruptions we can tolerate, while identifying the correct support. To the best of our knowledge, neither standard outlier rejection techniques, nor recently developed robust regression algorithms (that focus only on corrupted response variables), nor recent algorithms for dealing with stochastic noise or erasures, can provide guarantees on support recovery. As we show, neither can the natural brute force algorithm that takes exponential time to find the subset of data and support columns, that yields the smallest regression error. We explore the power of a simple idea: replace the essential linear algebraic calculation – the inner product – with a robust counterpart that cannot be greatly affected by a controlled number of arbitrarily corrupted points: the trimmed inner product. We consider three popular algorithms in the uncorrupted setting: Thresholding Regression, Lasso, and the Dantzig selector, and show that the counterparts obtained using the trimmed inner product are provably robust."

We start by modeling the rich spatio-temporal relations between human poses and objects (called affordances) using a conditional random field (CRF). However, because of the ambiguity in the temporal segmentation of the sub-activities that constitute an activity, in the past as well as in the future, multiple graph structures are possible. In this paper, we reason about these alternate possibilities by reasoning over multiple possible graph structures. We obtain them by approximating the graph with only additive features, which lends to efficient dynamic programming. Starting with this proposal graph structure, we then design moves to obtain several other likely graph structures. We then show that our approach improves the state-of-the-art significantly for detecting past activities as well as for anticipating future activities, on a dataset of 120 activity videos collected from four subjects."

While consistency has been proposed as a desirable property for multiclass loss functions, we give experimental and theoretical results exhibiting a sequence of linearly separable data sources with the following property: a multiclass classification algorithm which optimizes a loss function due to Crammer and Singer (which is known not to be consistent) produces classifiers whose expected error goes to 0, while the expected error of an algorithm which optimizes a generalization of the loss function used by LogitBoost (a loss function which is known to be consistent) is bounded below by a positive constant. We identify a property of a loss function, realizable consistency with respect to a restricted class of scoring functions, that accounts for this difference. As our main technical results we show that the Crammer–Singer loss function is realizable consistent for the class of linear scoring functions, while the generalization of LogitBoost is not. Our result for LogitBoost is a special case of a more general theorem that applies to several other loss functions that have been proposed for multiclass classification."

Using background knowledge, causal interpretations allow us to determine the correct situation for a problem at hand. We exploit importance reweighting or sample transformation to find the learning machine that works well on test data, and propose to estimate the weights or transformations by \it reweighting or transforming training data to reproduce the covariate distribution on the test domain. Thanks to kernel embedding of conditional as well as marginal distributions, the proposed approaches avoid distribution estimation, and are applicable for high-dimensional problems. Numerical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

These models are often trained on a small number of examples with large internal structure. Existing distribution-free generalization bounds do not guarantee generalization in this setting, though this contradicts a large body of empirical evidence from computer vision, natural language processing, social networks and other fields. In this paper, we identify a set of natural conditions – weak dependence, hypothesis complexity and a new measure, collective stability – that are sufficient for generalization from even a single example, without imposing an explicit generative model of the data. We then demonstrate that the complexity and stability conditions are satisfied by a broad class of models, including marginal inference in templated graphical models. We thus obtain uniform convergence rates that can decrease significantly faster than previous bounds, particularly when each structured example is sufficiently large and the number of training examples is constant, even one."

User feedback takes the form of preferences, and recent work has introduced online algorithms that learn from this weak feedback. However, we show that these algorithms can be unstable and ineffective in real-world settings where biases and noise in the feedback are significant. In this paper, we propose the first coactive learning algorithm that can learn robustly despite bias and noise. In particular, we explore how presenting users with slightly perturbed objects (e.g., rankings) can stabilize the learning process. We theoretically validate the algorithm by proving bounds on the average regret. We also provide extensive empirical evidence on benchmarks and from a live search engine user study, showing that the new algorithm substantially outperforms existing methods."

A number of emerging techniques specifically include a codebook learning step, in which a critical knowledge abstraction process is carried out. Existing approaches in dictionary (codebook) learning are either generative (unsupervised e.g. k-means) or discriminative (supervised e.g. extremely randomized forests). In this paper, we propose a multiple instance learning (MIL) strategy (along the line of weakly supervised learning) for dictionary learning. Each code is represented by a classifier, such as a linear SVM, which naturally performs metric fusion for multi-channel features. We design a formulation to simultaneously learn mixtures of codes by maximizing classification margins in MIL.

The resulting algorithms, which repeatedly compute and then efficiently optimize submodular semigradients, offer new and generalize many old methods for submodular optimization. Our approach, moreover, takes steps towards providing a unifying paradigm applicable to both submodular minimization and maximization, problems that historically have been treated quite distinctly. The practicality of our algorithms is important since interest in submodularity, owing to its natural and wide applicability, has recently been in ascendance within machine learning.

Kernel functions have been introduced to matrix factorization to integrate side information about the rows and columns (e.g., objects and users in recommender systems), which is necessary for making out-of-matrix (i.e., cold start) predictions. We discuss specifically bipartite graph inference, where the output matrix is binary, but extensions to more general matrices are straightforward. We extend the state of the art in two key aspects: (i) A fully conjugate probabilistic formulation of the kernelized matrix factorization problem enables an efficient variational approximation, whereas fully Bayesian treatments are not computationally feasible in the earlier approaches. (ii) Multiple side information sources are included, treated as different kernels in multiple kernel learning that additionally reveals which side information sources are informative. Our method outperforms alternatives in predicting drug-protein interactions on two data sets. We then show that our framework can also be used for solving multilabel learning problems by considering samples and labels as the two domains where matrix factorization operates on. Our algorithm obtains the lowest Hamming loss values on 10 out of 14 multilabel classification data sets compared to five state-of-the-art multilabel learning algorithms."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/gens13.pdf,Learning the Structure of Sum-Product Networks,"Robert Gens, Domingos Pedro","Sum-product networks (SPNs) are a new class of deep probabilistic models. SPNs can have unbounded treewidth but inference in them is always tractable. An SPN is either a univariate distribution, a product of SPNs over disjoint variables, or a weighted sum of SPNs over the same variables. We propose the first algorithm for learning the structure of SPNs that takes full advantage of their expressiveness. At each step, the algorithm attempts to divide the current variables into approximately independent subsets. If successful, it returns the product of recursive calls on the subsets; otherwise it returns the sum of recursive calls on subsets of similar instances from the current training set. A comprehensive empirical study shows that the learned SPNs are typically comparable to graphical models in likelihood but superior in inference speed and accuracy."

It can be expressed as a linear program, and interior-point methods can be used to find a solution for moderately large problems. Dealing with very large problems, \emphe.g., involving data up to and beyond the terabyte regime, remains a challenge. Here, we present a randomized algorithm that runs in time that is nearly linear in the size of the input and that, with constant probability, computes a (1+ε) approximate solution to an arbitrary quantile regression problem. Our algorithm computes a low-distortion subspace-preserving embedding with respect to the loss function of quantile regression. Our empirical evaluation illustrates that our algorithm is competitive with the best previous work on small to medium-sized problems, and that it can be implemented in MapReduce-like environments and applied to terabyte-sized problems."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/meng13b.pdf,Robust Regression on MapReduce,"Xiangrui Meng, Michael Mahoney","Although the MapReduce framework is now the \emphde facto standard for analyzing massive data sets, many algorithms (in particular, many iterative algorithms popular in machine learning, optimization, and linear algebra) are hard to fit into MapReduce. Consider, \emphe.g., the \ell_p regression problem: given a matrix A ∈\mathbbR^m \times n and a vector b ∈\mathbbR^m, find a vector x^* ∈\mathbbR^n that minimizes f(x) = \|A x - b\|_p. The widely-used \ell_2 regression, \emphi.e., linear least-squares, is known to be highly sensitive to outliers; and choosing p ∈[1, 2) can help improve robustness. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for solving strongly over-determined (m ≫n) robust \ell_p regression problems to moderate precision on MapReduce. Our empirical results on data up to the terabyte scale demonstrate that our algorithm is a significant improvement over traditional iterative algorithms on MapReduce for \ell_1 regression, even for a fairly small number of iterations. In addition, our proposed interior-point cutting-plane method can also be extended to solving more general convex problems on MapReduce."

Training S3VM involves either a combinatorial or non-convex optimization problem and thus finding the global optimal solution is intractable in practice. It has been demonstrated that a key to successfully find a good (local) solution of S3VM is to gradually increase the effect of unlabeled data, a la annealing. However, existing algorithms suffer from the trade-off between the resolution of annealing steps and the computation cost. In this paper, we go beyond this trade-off by proposing a novel training algorithm that efficiently performs annealing with an infinitesimal resolution. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed infinitesimal annealing algorithm tends to produce better solutions with less computation time than existing approaches."

In this work, we focus on one-pass AUC optimization that requires only going through the training data once without storing the entire training dataset, where conventional online learning algorithms cannot be applied directly because AUC is measured by a sum of losses defined over pairs of instances from different classes. We develop a regression-based algorithm which only needs to maintain the first and second order statistics of training data in memory, resulting a storage requirement independent from the size of training data. To efficiently handle high dimensional data, we develop a randomized algorithm that approximates the covariance matrices by low rank matrices. We verify, both theoretically and empirically, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

Our approach builds on a convex quadratic programming relaxation of the MAP inference problem. The model parameters are trained directly within this restricted class of energy functions so as to optimize the predictions on the training data. We address the issue of how to parameterize the resulting model and point out its relation to existing approaches. The primary motivation behind our use of the QP relaxation is its computational efficiency; yet, empirically, its predictive accuracy compares favorably to more expensive approaches. This makes it an appealing choice for many practical tasks."

The company has an objective function, such as maximising revenue, customer satisfaction, or customer loyalty, which depends primarily on the sequence of interactions between company and customer. A key aspect of this setting is that interactions with different customers occur in parallel. As a result, it is imperative to learn online from partial interaction sequences, so that information acquired from one customer is efficiently assimilated and applied in subsequent interactions with other customers. We present the first framework for concurrent reinforcement learning, using a variant of temporal-difference learning to learn efficiently from partial interaction sequences. We evaluate our algorithms in two large-scale test-beds for online and email interaction respectively, generated from a database of 300,000 customer records."

To address this problem, in previous work the base learners are sequentially calculated and early stopping is allowed if the decision function has been confident enough to output its value. In such a chain structure, the order of base learners is critical: better order can lead to less evaluation time. In this paper, we present a novel method for ordering. We base our discussion on the data structure representing Boosting’s decision function. Viewing the decision function a boolean expression, we propose a Binary Valued Tree for its representation. As a secondary contribution, such a representation unifies the work by previous researchers and helps devise new representation. Also, its connection to Binary Decision Diagram(BDD) is discussed."

Particularly, we conduct a theoretical analysis of HTL by considering the algorithmic stability of a class of HTL algorithms based on Regularized Least Squares with biased regularization. We show that the relatedness of source and target domains accelerates the convergence of the Leave-One-Out error to the generalization error, thus enabling the use of the Leave-One-Out error to find the optimal transfer parameters, even in the presence of a small training set. In case of unrelated domains we also suggest a theoretically principled way to prevent negative transfer, so that in the limit we recover the performance of the algorithm not using any knowledge from the source domain."

Bayesian inference in non-conjugate LGM is difficult due to intractable integrals involving the Gaussian prior and non-conjugate likelihoods. Algorithms based on Variational Gaussian (VG) approximations are widely employed since they strike a favorable balance between accuracy, generality, speed, and ease of use. However, the structure of optimization problems associated with them remains poorly understood, and standard solvers take too long to converge. In this paper, we derive a novel dual variational inference approach, which exploits the convexity property of the VG approximations. The implications of our approach is that we obtain an algorithm that solves a convex optimization problem, reduces the number of variational parameters, and converges much faster than previous methods. Using real world data, we demonstrate these advantages on a variety of LGMs including Gaussian process classification and latent Gaussian Markov random fields."

We propose a model for temporally correlated multifurcating hierarchies in complex networks which jointly capture both effects. We use the Gibbs fragmentation tree as prior over multifurcating trees and a change-point model to account for the temporal evolution of each vertex. We demonstrate that our model is able to infer time-varying multiscale structure in synthetic as well as three real world time-evolving complex networks. Our modeling of the temporal evolution of hierarchies brings new insights into the changing roles and position of entities and possibilities for better understanding these dynamic complex systems.

Our constructions, which we call mixed normalized random measures (MNRM) and thinned normalized random measures (TNRM), involve (respectively) weighting and thinning parts of a shared underlying Poisson process before combining them together. We show that both MNRM and TNRM are marginally normalized random measures, resulting in well understood theoretical properties. We develop marginal and slice samplers for both models, the latter necessary for inference in TNRM. In time-varying topic modelling experiments, both models exhibit superior performance over related dependent models such as the hierarchical Dirichlet process and the spatial normalized Gamma process."

In this paper we present a probabilistic M3F model that admits a highly efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm through data augmentation. We further extend our approach to incorporate Bayesian nonparametrics and build accordingly a truncation-free nonparametric M3F model where the number of latent factors is literally unbounded and inferred from data. Empirical studies on two large real-world data sets verify the efficacy of our proposed methods.

Computerized methods have been shown to be equally or more effective than human clinicians in diagnosing dementia from neuroimages. Nevertheless, much of the work involves the use of domain expertise to extract hand-crafted features. The key technique in this paper is the use of cross-domain features to represent MRI data. We used a sparse autoencoder to learn a set of bases from natural images and then applied convolution to extract features from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.Using this new representation, we classify MRI instances into three categories: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Healthy Control (HC).Our approach, in spite of being very simple, achieved high classification performance, which is competitive with or better than other approaches."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/ailon13.pdf,Breaking the Small Cluster Barrier of Graph Clustering,"Nir Ailon, Yudong Chen, Huan Xu","This paper investigates graph clustering in the planted cluster model in the presence of \em small clusters. Traditional results dictate that for an algorithm to provably correctly recover the clusters, \em all clusters must be sufficiently large (in particular, \tildeΩ(\sqrtn) where n is the number of nodes of the graph). We show that this is not really a restriction: by a more refined analysis of the trace-norm based matrix recovery approach proposed in (Jalali et al. 2011) and (Chen et al. 2012), we prove that small clusters, under certain mild assuptions, do not hinder recovery of large ones. Based on this result, we further devise an iterative algorithm to recover \em almost all clusters via a “peeling strategy”, i.e., recover large clusters first, leading to a reduced problem, and repeat this procedure. These results are extended to the \em partial observation setting, in which only a (chosen) part of the graph is observed. The peeling strategy gives rise to an active learning algorithm, in which edges adjacent to smaller clusters are queried more often as large clusters are learned (and removed). Our findings are supported by experiments. From a high level, this paper sheds novel insights on high-dimesional statistics and learning structured data, by presenting a structured matrix learning problem for which a one shot convex relaxation approach necessarily fails, but a carefully constructed sequence of convex relaxations does the job."

We first analyze the complexity of inference in CGMs: unlike inference in conventional graphical models, exact inference in CGMs is NP-hard even for tree-structured models. We then develop a tractable convex approximation to the NP-hard MAP inference problem in CGMs, and show how to use MAP inference for approximate marginal inference within the EM framework. We demonstrate empirically that these approximation techniques can reduce the computational cost of inference by two orders of magnitude and the cost of learning by at least an order of magnitude while providing solutions of equal or better quality."

In this work, we use Kurihara & Wellings (2008)’s maximization-expectation framework to perform approximate MAP inference for linear-Gaussian latent feature models with an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior. This formulation yields a submodular function of the features that corresponds to a lower bound on the model evidence. By adding a constant to this function, we obtain a nonnegative submodular function that can be maximized via a greedy algorithm that obtains at least a 1/3-approximation to the optimal solution. Our inference method scales linearly with the size of the input data, and we show the efficacy of our method on the largest datasets currently analyzed using an IBP model."

Correspondingly, many results are known about its behavior for a fixed or optimally chosen smoothing parameter (given up to unknown constants). Much less, however, is known about the lasso’s behavior when the smoothing parameter is chosen in a data dependent way. To this end, we give the first result about the risk consistency of lasso when the smoothing parameter is chosen via cross-validation.

When training with Dropout, a randomly selected subset of activations are set to zero within each layer. DropConnect instead sets a randomly selected subset of weights within the network to zero. Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of units in the previous layer. We derive a bound on the generalization performance of both Dropout and DropConnect. We then evaluate DropConnect on a range of datasets, comparing to Dropout, and show state-of-the-art results on several image recoginition benchmarks can be obtained by aggregating multiple DropConnect-trained models."

These kernels are derived by modelling a spectral density – the Fourier transform of a kernel – with a Gaussian mixture. The proposed kernels support a broad class of stationary covariances, but Gaussian process inference remains simple and analytic. We demonstrate the proposed kernels by discovering patterns and performing long range extrapolation on synthetic examples, as well as atmospheric CO2 trends and airline passenger data. We also show that it is possible to reconstruct several popular standard covariances within our framework."

On the other hand, while the non-convex 0–1 loss is robust to outliers, it is NP-hard to optimize and thus rarely directly optimized in practice. In this paper, however, we do just that: we explore a variety of practical methods for direct (approximate) optimization of the 0–1 loss based on branch and bound search, combinatorial search, and coordinate descent on smooth, differentiable relaxations of 0–1 loss. Empirically, we compare our proposed algorithms to logistic regression, SVM, and the Bayes point machine showing that the proposed 0–1 loss optimization algorithms perform at least as well and offer a clear advantage in the presence of outliers. To this end, we believe this work reiterates the importance of 0–1 loss and its robustness properties while challenging the notion that it is difficult to directly optimize."

Problems of similar kind have been tackled by means of adaptive sampling schemes called racing algorithms. However, in contrast to existing approaches, we do not assume that each alternative is characterized by a real-valued random variable, and that samples are taken from the corresponding distributions. Instead, we only assume that alternatives can be compared in terms of pairwise preferences. We propose and formally analyze a general preference-based racing algorithm that we instantiate with three specific ranking procedures and corresponding sampling schemes. Experiments with real and synthetic data are presented to show the efficiency of our approach."

Particle filters fail for models that include such variables, while methods that use Gibbs sampling of parameter variables may incur a per-sample cost that grows linearly with the length of the observation sequence. Storvik devised a method for incremental computation of exact sufficient statistics that, for some cases, reduces the per-sample cost to a constant. In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between Storvik’s filter and a Kalman filter in parameter space and establish more general conditions under which Storvik’s filter works. Drawing on an analogy to the extended Kalman filter, we develop and analyze, both theoretically and experimentally, a Taylor approximation to the parameter posterior that allows Storvik’s method to be applied to a broader class of models.

When facing complex domains, such as the positive semidefinite cone, the projection operation can be expensive, leading to a high computational cost per iteration. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that aims to reduce the number of projections for stochastic optimization. The proposed algorithm combines the strength of several recent developments in stochastic optimization, including mini-batches, extra-gradient, and epoch gradient descent, in order to effectively explore the smoothness and strong convexity. We show, both in expectation and with a high probability, that when the objective function is both smooth and strongly convex, the proposed algorithm achieves the optimal O(1/T) rate of convergence with only O(logT) projections.

Whereas the former derives an optimal prediction from a probabilistic model in a separate inference step, the latter seeks to optimize the F-measure directly during the training phase. We introduce a novel plug-in rule algorithm that estimates all parameters required for a Bayes-optimal prediction via a set of multinomial regression models, and we compare this algorithm with SSVMs in terms of computational complexity and statistical consistency. As a main theoretical result, we show that our plug-in rule algorithm is consistent, whereas the SSVM approaches are not.

In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned. Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods."

First, while previous RBM research has focused on modeling the correlation between item ratings, we model both user-user and item-item correlations in a unified hybrid non-IID framework. We further use real values in the visible layer as opposed to multinomial variables, thus taking advantage of the natural order between user-item ratings. Finally, we explore the potential of combining the original training data with data generated by the RBM-based model itself in a bootstrapping fashion. The evaluation on two MovieLens datasets (with 100K and 1M user-item ratings, respectively), shows that our RBM model rivals the best previously-proposed approaches."

Variations of this task appear in such diverse areas as social network analysis, security, fraud detection, and entity resolution. To address the task in a general form, we propose a simple, flexible mixture model in which most entities are generated independently from a distribution but a small number of pairs are constrained to be similar. We predict the true pairs using a likelihood ratio that trades off the entities’ similarity with their rarity. This method always outperforms using only similarity; however, with certain parameter settings, similarity turns out to be surprisingly competitive. Using real data, we apply the model to detect twins given their birth weights and to re-identify cell phone users based on distinctive usage patterns."

Operations which result in functions outside the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (such as the product of two RKHS functions) are approximated via a natural cost function, such that the solution is guaranteed to be in the targeted RKHS. This approximation problem is reduced to a regression problem using an adjoint trick, and solved in a vector-valued RKHS, consisting of continuous, linear, smooth operators which map from an input, real-valued RKHS to the desired target RKHS. Important constraints, such as an almost everywhere positive density, can be enforced or approximated naturally in this framework, using convex constraints on the operators. Finally, smooth operators can be composed to accomplish more complex machine learning tasks, such as the sum rule and kernelized approximate Bayesian inference, where state-of-the-art convergence rates are obtained."

We show that, in the kind of noisy evaluation environments that are common in decision-making domains, this percentage-based refocusing does not optimize the expected utility of solutions, but instead a quantile metric. We provide a variant of CE (Proportional CE) that effectively optimizes the expected value.

Our key insight here is that the maximum and minimum values of cross-document frequency patterns projected along any direction are associated with novel words. While our sample complexity bounds for topic recovery are similar to the state-of-art, the computational complexity of our random projection scheme scales linearly with the number of documents and the number of words per document. We present several experiments on synthetic and realworld datasets to demonstrate qualitative and quantitative merits of our scheme."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/bellemare13.pdf,Bayesian Learning of Recursively Factored Environments,"Marc Bellemare, Joel Veness, Michael Bowling","Model-based reinforcement learning techniques have historically encountered a number of difficulties scaling up to large observation spaces. One promising approach has been to decompose the model learning task into a number of smaller, more manageable sub-problems by factoring the observation space. Typically, many different factorizations are possible, which can make it difficult to select an appropriate factorization without extensive testing. In this paper we introduce the class of recursively decomposable factorizations, and show how exact Bayesian inference can be used to efficiently guarantee predictive performance close to the best factorization in this class. We demonstrate the strength of this approach by presenting a collection of empirical results for 20 different Atari 2600 games."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/agarwal13.pdf,Selective sampling algorithms for cost-sensitive multiclass prediction,Alekh Agarwal,"In this paper, we study the problem of active learning for cost-sensitive multiclass classification. We propose selective sampling algorithms, which process the data in a streaming fashion, querying only a subset of the labels. For these algorithms, we analyze the regret and label complexity when the labels are generated according to a generalized linear model. We establish that the gains of active learning over passive learning can range from none to exponentially large, based on a natural notion of margin. We also present a safety guarantee to guard against model mismatch. Numerical simulations show that our algorithms indeed obtain a low regret with a small number of queries."

Lawrence, Shuheng Zhou","The i.i.d. assumption in machine learning is endemic, but often flawed. Complex data sets exhibit partial correlations between both instances and features. A model specifying both types of correlation can have a number of parameters that scales quadratically with the number of features and data points. We introduce the bigraphical lasso, an estimator for precision matrices of matrix-normals based on the Cartesian product of graphs. A prominent product in spectral graph theory, this structure has appealing properties for regression, enhanced sparsity and interpretability. To deal with the parameter explosion we introduce L1 penalties and fit the model through a flip-flop algorithm that results in a linear number of lasso regressions."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/karnin13.pdf,Almost Optimal Exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits,"Zohar Karnin, Tomer Koren, Oren Somekh","We study the problem of exploration in stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits. Even in the simplest setting of identifying the best arm, there remains a logarithmic multiplicative gap between the known lower and upper bounds for the number of arm pulls required for the task. This extra logarithmic factor is quite meaningful in nowadays large-scale applications. We present two novel, parameter-free algorithms for identifying the best arm, in two different settings: given a target confidence and given a target budget of arm pulls, for which we prove upper bounds whose gap from the lower bound is only doubly-logarithmic in the problem parameters. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments demonstrating that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art and scales better as the size of the problem increases."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/andrew13.pdf,Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis,"Galen Andrew, Raman Arora, Jeff Bilmes, Karen Livescu","We introduce Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA), a method to learn complex nonlinear transformations of two views of data such that the resulting representations are highly linearly correlated. Parameters of both transformations are jointly learned to maximize the (regularized) total correlation. It can be viewed as a nonlinear extension of the linear method \emphcanonical correlation analysis (CCA). It is an alternative to the nonparametric method \emphkernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) for learning correlated nonlinear transformations. Unlike KCCA, DCCA does not require an inner product, and has the advantages of a parametric method: training time scales well with data size and the training data need not be referenced when computing the representations of unseen instances. In experiments on two real-world datasets, we find that DCCA learns representations with significantly higher correlation than those learned by CCA and KCCA. We also introduce a novel non-saturating sigmoid function based on the cube root that may be useful more generally in feedforward neural networks."

The model has been proposed by multiple researchers within the past year, yet previous papers have been substantially limited in their analysis of the method and in the ability to solve large-scale problems. In this paper, we make three contributions: 1) we develop a second-order active-set method which is several orders of magnitude faster that previously proposed optimization approaches for this problem 2) we analyze the model from a theoretical standpoint, improving upon past bounds with convergence rates that depend logarithmically on the data dimension, and 3) we apply the method to large-scale energy forecasting problems, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on two real-world tasks."

Recent advances have significantly improved the state-of-the-art in retrieval accuracy with algorithms based on nearest neighbor classification in carefully learned metric spaces. But this comes at a price of increased computational complexity during training and testing. We propose FastTag, a novel algorithm that achieves comparable results with two simple linear mappings that are co-regularized in a joint convex loss function. The loss function can be efficiently optimized in closed form updates, which allows us to incorporate a large number of image descriptors cheaply. On several standard real-world benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that FastTag matches the current state-of-the-art in tagging quality, yet reduces the training and testing times by several orders of magnitude and has lower asymptotic complexity."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/tesch13.pdf,Expensive Function Optimization with Stochastic Binary Outcomes,"Matthew Tesch, Jeff Schneider, Howie Choset","Real world systems often have parameterized controllers which can be tuned to improve performance. Bayesian optimization methods provide for efficient optimization of these controllers, so as to reduce the number of required experiments on the expensive physical system. In this paper we address Bayesian optimization in the setting where performance is only observed through a stochastic binary outcome – success or failure of the experiment. Unlike bandit problems, the goal is to maximize the system performance after this offline training phase rather than minimize regret during training. In this work we define the stochastic binary optimization problem and propose an approach using an adaptation of Gaussian Processes for classification that presents a Bayesian optimization framework for this problem. We propose an experiment selection metric for this setting based on expected improvement. We demonstrate the algorithm’s performance on synthetic problems and on a real snake robot learning to move over an obstacle."

The typical procedure, in which data points are randomly assigned to one of the test sets, makes an implicit assumption that the data are exchangeable. A common case in which this does not hold is when the data come from multiple sources, in the sense used in transfer learning. In this case it is common to arrange the cross-validation procedure in a way that takes the source structure into account. Although common in practice, this procedure does not appear to have been theoretically analysed. We present new estimators of the variance of the cross-validation, both in the multiple-source setting and in the standard iid setting. These new estimators allow for much more accurate confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to compare algorithms."

In this paper, we study these critical questions in social network analysis quantitatively under the framework of multi-dimensional Hawkes processes. In particular, we focus on the nonparametric learning of the triggering kernels, and propose an algorithm \sf MMEL that combines the idea of decoupling the parameters through constructing a tight upper-bound of the objective function and application of Euler-Lagrange equations for optimization in infinite dimensional functional space. We show that the proposed method performs significantly better than alternatives in experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets."

(1994). In this paper we attempt to improve the understanding of the underlying issues by exploring these problems from an analytical, a geometric and a dynamical systems perspective. Our analysis is used to justify a simple yet effective solution. We propose a gradient norm clipping strategy to deal with exploding gradients and a soft constraint for the vanishing gradients problem. We validate empirically our hypothesis and proposed solutions in the experimental section."

We define a simple new model called maxout (so named because its output is the max of a set of inputs, and because it is a natural companion to dropout) designed to both facilitate optimization by dropout and improve the accuracy of dropout's fast approximate model averaging technique. We empirically verify that the model successfully accomplishes both of these tasks. We use maxout and dropout to demonstrate state of the art classification performance on four benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN."

We create a cross-view hamming space with the ability to compare information from previously incomparable domains with a notion of ‘predictability’. By performing comparative experimental analysis on two large datasets, PASCAL-Sentence and SUN-Attribute, we demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state-of-the-art dual-view binary code learning algorithms."

Recent efforts to train extremely large networks (with over 1 billion parameters) have relied on cloud-like computing infrastructure and thousands of CPU cores. In this paper, we present technical details and results from our own system based on Commodity Off-The-Shelf High Performance Computing (COTS HPC) technology: a cluster of GPU servers with Infiniband interconnects and MPI. Our system is able to train 1 billion parameter networks on just 3 machines in a couple of days, and we show that it can scale to networks with over 11 billion parameters using just 16 machines. As this infrastructure is much more easily marshaled by others, the approach enables much wider-spread research with extremely large neural networks."

We claim that individuals should be grouped according to biological and/or genetic similarity regardless of their level of disease severity; therefore, we introduce a new way of looking at subtyping/clustering by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories (i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables). The nonparametric nature of our algorithm allows for learning the unknown number of meaningful trajectories. Additionally, we acknowledge the usefulness of expert guidance by providing for their input using must-link and cannot- link constraints. These constraints are encoded with Markov random fields. We also provide an efficient variational approach for performing inference on our model."

An attractive property of these measures and estimators is that they are invariant to any monotone increasing transformations of the random variables, which is important in many applications including feature selection. Under certain conditions we show the consistency of these estimators, derive upper bounds on their convergence rates, and show that the estimators do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. However, when the conditions are less restrictive, we derive a lower bound which proves that in the worst case the convergence can be arbitrarily slow similarly to some other estimators. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the applicability of our method."

Such lists are often evaluated using submodular reward functions that measure both quality and diversity. We propose a simple, efficient, and provably near-optimal approach to optimizing such prediction problems based on no-regret learning. Our method leverages a surprising result from online submodular optimization: a single no-regret online learner can compete with an optimal sequence of predictions. Compared to previous work, which either learn a sequence of classifiers or rely on stronger assumptions such as realizability, we ensure both data-efficiency as well as performance guarantees in the fully agnostic setting. Experiments validate the efficiency and applicability of the approach on a wide range of problems including manipulator trajectory optimization, news recommendation and document summarization."

First, we propose a quantization method with an additional mid-layer latent variable, which selects only data points that best preserve the manifold structure of the input data. In order to address the case of modeling all the in-between parts of that manifold using this reduced representation of the input, we introduce a new model that provides a manifold-aware interpolation method. We demonstrate the advantages of these models with experiments on the hand-written digit recognition and the speech source separation tasks."

Based on a recently proposed framework so-called safe screening rule, we derive a rule for screening out non-SVs in advance, and discuss how we can exploit the advantage of the rule in pathwise SVM computation scenario. Experiments indicate that our approach often substantially reduce the total pathwise computation cost."
icml,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/avilapires13.pdf,Cost-sensitive Multiclass Classification Risk Bounds,"Bernardo Ávila Pires, Csaba Szepesvari, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh","A commonly used approach to multiclass classification is to replace the 0-1 loss with a convex surrogate so as to make empirical risk minimization computationally tractable. Previous work has uncovered sufficient and necessary conditions for the consistency of the resulting procedures. In this paper, we strengthen these results by showing how the 0-1 excess loss of a predictor can be upper bounded as a function of the excess loss of the predictor measured using the convex surrogate. The bound is developed for the case of cost-sensitive multiclass classification and a convex surrogate loss that goes back to the work of Lee, Lin and Wahba. The bounds are as easy to calculate as in binary classification. Furthermore, we also show that our analysis extends to the analysis of the recently introduced “Simplex Coding” scheme."

Despite the progress, there are two main shortcomings of the existing semi-supervised clustering algorithms. First, they have to deal with non-convex optimization problems, leading to clustering results that are sensitive to the initialization. Second, none of these algorithms is equipped with theoretical guarantee regarding the clustering performance. We address these limitations by developing a framework for semi-supervised clustering based on \it input pattern assisted matrix completion. The key idea is to cast clustering into a matrix completion problem, and solve it efficiently by exploiting the correlation between input patterns and cluster assignments. Our analysis shows that under appropriate conditions, only O(\log n) pairwise constraints are needed to accurately recover the true cluster partition. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing it to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised clustering algorithms on several benchmark datasets."

Such cost functions are useful for Nonnegative Matrix and Tensor Factorization models with a compound Poisson observation model. Compound Poisson is a particular Tweedie model, an important special case of exponential dispersion models characterized by the fact that the variance is proportional to a power function of the mean. There are several well known matrix and tensor factorization algorithms that minimize the β-divergence; these estimate the mean parameter. The probabilistic interpretation gives us more flexibility and robustness by providing us additional tunable parameters such as power and dispersion. Estimation of the power parameter is useful for choosing a suitable divergence and estimation of dispersion is useful for data driven regularization and weighting in collective/coupled factorization of heterogeneous datasets. We present three inference algorithms for both estimating the factors and the additional parameters of the compound Poisson distribution. The methods are evaluated on two applications: modeling symbolic representations for polyphonic music and lyric prediction from audio features. Our conclusion is that the compound poisson based factorization models can be useful for sparse positive data."

Our algorithms possess a cubic rate of convergence and can compute principal components with k non-zero elements at a cost of O(nk + k^3) flops per iteration. We observe in numerical experiments that these components are of equal or greater quality than ones obtained from current state-of-the-art techniques, but require between one and two orders of magnitude fewer flops to be computed. Conceptually, our approach generalizes the Rayleigh quotient iteration algorithm for computing eigenvectors, and can be interpreted as a type of second-order optimization method. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms on several datasets, including the STL-10 machine vision dataset and gene expression data."

Moreover, this hierarchy is often shared between different instances. We introduce the nested Chinese Restaurant Franchise Process as a means to obtain both hierarchical tree-structured representations for objects, akin to (but more general than) the nested Chinese Restaurant Process while sharing their structure akin to the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process. Moreover, by decoupling the \emphstructure generating part of the process from the components responsible for the observations, we are able to apply the same statistical approach to a variety of user generated data. In particular, we model the joint distribution of microblogs and locations for Twitter for users. This leads to a 40% reduction in location uncertainty relative to the best previously published results. Moreover, we model documents from the NIPS papers dataset, obtaining excellent perplexity relative to (hierarchical) Pachinko allocation and LDA."

Unfortunately, developing dual-tree algorithms for use with different trees and problems is often complex and burdensome. We introduce a four-part logical split: the tree, the traversal, the point-to-point base case, and the pruning rule. We provide a meta-algorithm which allows development of dual-tree algorithms in a tree-independent manner and easy extension to entirely new types of trees. Representations are provided for five common algorithms; for k-nearest neighbor search, this leads to a novel, tighter pruning bound. The meta-algorithm also allows straightforward extensions to massively parallel settings."

With such datasets, the tasks to be learnt can be referenced by multiple indices. Current multitask learning frameworks are not designed to account for the preservation of this information. We propose the use of multilinear algebra as a natural way to model such a set of related tasks. We present two learning methods; one is an adapted convex relaxation method used in the context of tensor completion. The second method is based on the Tucker decomposition and on alternating minimization. Experiments on synthetic and real data indicate that the multilinear approaches provide a significant improvement over other multitask learning methods. Overall our second approach yields the best performance in all datasets."

In this paper we provide a systematic study of the topic, and analyze the effect of delay on the regret of online learning algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that delay increases the regret in a multiplicative way in adversarial problems, and in an additive way in stochastic problems. We give meta-algorithms that transform, in a black-box fashion, algorithms developed for the non-delayed case into ones that can handle the presence of delays in the feedback loop. Modifications of the well-known UCB algorithm are also developed for the bandit problem with delayed feedback, with the advantage over the meta-algorithms that they can be implemented with lower complexity."

We develop an algorithm that allows for the adaptation of Hamiltonian and Riemann manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers using Bayesian optimization that allows for infinite adaptation of the parameters of these samplers. We show that the resulting sampling algorithms are ergodic, and demonstrate on several models and data sets that the use of our adaptive algorithms makes it is easy to obtain more efficient samplers, in some precluding the need for more complex models. Hamiltonian-based Monte Carlo samplers are widely known to be an excellent choice of MCMC method, and we aim with this paper to remove a key obstacle towards the more widespread use of these samplers in practice."

However, in many applications, features and data often originated from a Riemannian manifold that does not support a global linear (vector space) structure. Furthermore, the extrinsic viewpoint of existing dictionary learning algorithms becomes inappropriate for modeling and incorporating the intrinsic geometry of the manifold that is potentially important and critical to the application. This paper proposes a novel framework for sparse coding and dictionary learning for data on a Riemannian manifold, and it shows that the existing sparse coding and dictionary learning methods can be considered as special (Euclidean) cases of the more general framework proposed here. We show that both the dictionary and sparse coding can be effectively computed for several important classes of Riemannian manifolds, and we validate the proposed method using two well-known classification problems in computer vision and medical imaging analysis."

In this paper, we extend potential outcomes to allow for interference, we introduce well-defined causal estimands of peer-influence, and we develop two estimation procedures: a frequentist procedure relying on a sequential randomization design that requires knowledge of the network but operates under complicated response functions, and a Bayesian procedure which accounts for network uncertainty but relies on a linear response assumption to increase estimation precision. Our results show the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed methods in a number of situations."
