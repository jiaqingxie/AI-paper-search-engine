Hand, ","Financial applications of data science provide a perfect illustration of the power of the shift from subjective decision-making to data- and evidence-driven decision-making. In the space of some fifty years, an entire sector of industry has been totally revolutionised. Such applications come in three broad areas: actuarial and insurance, consumer banking, and investment banking. Actuarial and insurance work was one of the earliest adopters of data science ideas, dating from long before the term had been coined, and even before the computer had been invented. But these areas have fallen behind the latest advances in data science technology - which means there is considerable potential for applying modern data analytic ideas. Consumer banking has been described as one the first and major success stories of the data revolution. Dating from the 1960s, when the first credit cards were launched, techniques for analysing the massive data sets of consumer financial transactions have driven much of the development of data mining and data science ideas. But new model types, and new sources of data, are leading to a rich opportunity for significant developments. In investment banking the ""efficient market hypothesis"" of classic economics says that it is impossible to predict the financial markets. But this is false - though very nearly true. That means that there is an opportunity to use advanced data analytic methods to exploit the tiny gap between conventional theory and what actually happens. Other data science issues, such as data quality, ethics, and security, along with the need to understand the limitations of models, become particularly pointed in the context of financial applications."

Roth, ","Markets and marketplaces are ancient human artifacts, but in recent years they have become ever more important. In part this is because marketplaces are becoming computerized. Together with the introduction of smart phones, this also makes them ubiquitous. We can order car rides to the airport, plane rides to London, and hotel rooms for when we arrive, all on our smartphones. And as we do so we leave a data trail that is easily combined with other streams of data. This is changing not only how we interact with markets, but also how we manage and regard privacy. I'll discuss some recent developments in computerized markets and speculate about some still to come."
kdd,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3219819.3219941,On Big Data Learning for Small Data Problems,"Yee Whye Teh, ","Much recent progress in machine learning have been fueled by the explosive growth in the amount and diversity of data available, and the computational resources needed to crunch through the data. This begs the question of whether machine learning systems necessarily need large amounts of data to solve a task well. An exciting recent development, under the banners of meta-learning, lifelong learning, learning to learn, multitask learning etc., has been the observation that often there is heterogeneity within the data sets at hand, and in fact a large data set can be viewed more productively as many smaller data sets, each pertaining to a different task. For example, in recommender systems each user can be said to be a different task with a small associated data set, and in AI one holy grail is how to develop systems that can learn to solve new tasks quickly from small amounts of data. In such settings, the problem is then how to ""learn to learn quickly"", by making use of similarities among tasks. One perspective for how this is achievable is that exposure to lots of previous tasks allows the system to learn a rich prior knowledge about the world in which tasks are sampled from, and it is with rich world knowledge that the system is able to solve new tasks quickly. This is a very active, vibrant and diverse area of research, with many different approaches proposed recently. In this talk I will describe a view of this problem from probabilistic and deep learning perspectives, and describe a number of efforts in this direction that I have recently been involved in."
kdd,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3219819.3219942,Data for Good: Abstract,"Jeannette M. Wing, ","I use the tagline ""Data for Good"" to state paronomastically how we as a community should be promoting data science, especially in training future generations of data scientists. First, we should use data science for the good of humanity and society. Data science should be used to better people's lives. Data science should be used to improve relationships among people, organizations, and institutions. Data science, in collaboration with other disciplines, should be used to help tackle societal grand challenges such as climate change, education, energy, environment, healthcare, inequality, and social justice. Second, we should use data in a good manner. The acronym FATES suggests what ""good"" means. Fairness means that the models we build are used to make unbiased decisions or predictions. Accountability means to determine and assign responsibility-to someone or to something-for a judgment made by a machine. Transparency means being open and clear to the end user about how an outcome, e.g., a classification, a decision, or a prediction, is made. Ethics for data science means paying attention to both the ethical and privacy-preserving collection and use of data as well as the ethical decisions that the automated systems we build will make. Safety and security (yes, two words for one ""S"") means ensuring that the systems we build are safe (do no harm) and secure (guard against malicious behavior)."

After elevated levels of lead were detected in residents' drinking water, followed by an increase in blood lead levels in area children, the state and federal governments directed over $125 million to replace water service lines, the pipes connecting each home to the water system. In the absence of accurate records, and with the high cost of determining buried pipe materials, we put forth a number of predictive and procedural tools to aid in the search and removal of lead infrastructure. Alongside these statistical and machine learning approaches, we describe our interactions with government officials in recommending homes for both inspection and replacement, with a focus on the statistical model that adapts to incoming information. Finally, in light of discussions about increased spending on infrastructure development by the federal government, we explore how our approach generalizes beyond Flint to other municipalities nationwide."

Technical and non-technical deployment issues get relatively little attention. However, for machine learning models to have real-world benefit and impact, effective deployment is crucial. In this case study, we describe our implementation of a machine learning early intervention system (EIS) for police officers in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg (North Carolina) and Metropolitan Nashville (Tennessee) Police Departments. The EIS identifies officers at high risk of having an adverse incident, such as an unjustified use of force or sustained complaint. We deployed the same code base at both departments, which have different underlying data sources and data structures. Deployment required us to solve several new problems, covering technical implementation, governance of the system, the cost to use the system, and trust in the system. In this paper we describe how we addressed and solved several of these challenges and provide guidance and a framework of important issues to consider for future deployments."
kdd,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3219819.3219847,Online Parameter Selection for Web-based Ranking Problems,"Deepak Agarwal, Kinjal Basu, Souvik Ghosh, Ying Xuan, Yang Yang, ","Web-based ranking problems involve ordering different kinds of items in a list or grid to be displayed in mediums like a website or a mobile app. In most cases, there are multiple objectives or metrics like clicks, viral actions, job applications, advertising revenue and others that we want to balance. Constructing a serving algorithm that achieves the desired tradeoff among multiple objectives is challenging, especially for more than two objectives. In addition, it is often not possible to estimate such a serving scheme using offline data alone for non-stationary systems with frequent online interventions. We consider a large-scale online application where metrics for multiple objectives are continuously available and can be controlled in a desired fashion by changing certain control parameters in the ranking model. We assume that the desired balance of metrics is known from business considerations. Our approach models the balance criteria as a composite utility function via a Gaussian process over the space of control parameters. We show that obtaining a solution can be equated to finding the maximum of the Gaussian process, practically obtainable via Bayesian optimization. However, implementing such a scheme for large-scale applications is challenging. We provide a novel framework to do so and illustrate its efficacy in the context of LinkedIn Feed. In particular, we show the effectiveness of our method by using both offline simulations as well as promising online A/B testing results. At the time of writing this paper, the method described was fully deployed on the LinkedIn Feed."

To accommodate this increase in volume, a new concept of operations has been implemented in the context of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) in the USA and the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) in Europe. However, both of the systems approach airspace capacity and efficiency deterministically, failing to account for external operational circumstances which can directly affect the aircraft's actual flight profile. A major factor in increased airspace efficiency and capacity is accurate prediction of Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for commercial flights, which can be a challenging task due to a non-deterministic nature of environmental factors, and air traffic. Inaccurate prediction of ETA can cause potential safety risks and loss of resources for Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP), airlines and passengers. In this paper, we present a novel ETA Prediction System for commercial flights. The system learns from historical trajectories and uses their pertinent 3D grid points to collect key features such as weather parameters, air traffic, and airport data along the potential flight path. The features are fed into various regression models and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and the best performing models with the most accurate ETA predictions are compared with the ETAs currently operational by the European ANSP, EUROCONTROL. Evaluations on an extensive set of real trajectory, weather, and airport data in Europe verify that our prediction system generates more accurate ETAs with a far smaller standard deviation than those of EUROCONTROL. This translates to smaller prediction windows of flight arrival times, thereby enabling airlines to make more cost-effective ground resource allocation and ANSPs to make more efficient flight schedules."

Egleston, Slobodan Vucetic, ","Various deep learning models have recently been applied to predictive modeling of Electronic Health Records (EHR). In medical claims data, which is a particular type of EHR data, each patient is represented as a sequence of temporally ordered irregularly sampled visits to health providers, where each visit is recorded as an unordered set of medical codes specifying patient's diagnosis and treatment provided during the visit. Based on the observation that different patient conditions have different temporal progression patterns, in this paper we propose a novel interpretable deep learning model, called Timeline. The main novelty of Timeline is that it has a mechanism that learns time decay factors for every medical code. This allows the Timeline to learn that chronic conditions have a longer lasting impact on future visits than acute conditions. Timeline also has an attention mechanism that improves vector embeddings of visits. By analyzing the attention weights and disease progression functions of Timeline, it is possible to interpret the predictions and understand how risks of future visits change over time. We evaluated Timeline on two large-scale real world data sets. The specific task was to predict what is the primary diagnosis category for the next hospital visit given previous visits. Our results show that Timeline has higher accuracy than the state of the art deep learning models based on RNN. In addition, we demonstrate that time decay factors and attentions learned by Timeline are in accord with the medical knowledge and that Timeline can provide a useful insight into its predictions."

It is crucial for a sponsored search engine to retrieve ads that are relevant to user queries to attract clicks as advertisers only pay when their ads get clicked. Retrieving relevant ads for a query typically involves in first matching related ads to the query and then filtering out irrelevant ones. Both require understanding the semantic relationship between a query and an ad. In this work, we propose a novel embedding of queries and ads in sponsored search. The query embeddings are generated from constituent word n-gram embeddings that are trained to optimize an event level word2vec objective over a large volume of search data. We show through a query rewriting task that the proposed query n-gram embedding model outperforms the state-of-the-art word embedding models for capturing query semantics. This allows us to apply the proposed query n-gram embedding model to improve query-ad matching and relevance in sponsored search. First, we use the similarity between a query and an ad derived from the query n-gram embeddings as an additional feature in the query-ad relevance model used in Yahoo Search. We show through online A/B test that using the new relevance model to filter irrelevant ads offline leads to 0.47% CTR and 0.32% revenue increase. Second, we propose a novel online query to ads matching system, built on an open-source big-data serving engine [30], using the learned query n-gram embeddings. Online A/B test shows that the new matching technique increases the search revenue by 2.32% as it significantly increases the ad coverage for tail queries."

As more customers start purchasing consumable products (e.g., toothpastes, diapers, etc.) online, this phenomenon has also become prevalent in e-commerce. However, in January 2014, when we looked at popular e-commerce websites, we did not find any customer-facing features that recommended products to customers from their purchase history to promote repeat purchasing. Also, we found limited research about repeat purchase recommendations and none that deals with the large scale purchase data that e-commerce websites collect. In this paper, we present the approach we developed for modeling repeat purchase recommendations. This work has demonstrated over 7% increase in the product click through rate on the personalized recommendations page of the Amazon.com website and has resulted in the launch of several customer-facing features on the Amazon.com website, the Amazon mobile app, and other Amazon websites."

Sharing of image content has become one of the primary ways to communicate information among internet users within social networks such as Facebook, and the understanding of such media, including its textual information, is of paramount importance to facilitate search and recommendation applications. We present modeling techniques for efficient detection and recognition of text in images and describe Rosetta 's system architecture. We perform extensive evaluation of presented technologies, explain useful practical approaches to build an OCR system at scale, and provide insightful intuitions as to why and how certain components work based on the lessons learnt during the development and deployment of the system."

The challenges involve properly personalising the customer experience, forecasting demand and planning the product range. We argue that the foundational piece to solve all of these problems is having consistent and detailed information about each product, which is rarely available or consistent given the multitude of suppliers and types of products. We describe in detail the architecture and methodology implemented at ASOS, one of the world's largest fashion e-commerce retailers, to tackle this problem. We then show how this quantitative understanding of the products can be leveraged to improve recommendations in a hybrid recommender system approach."

Accurate estimation of TC intensity is crucial for disaster management. Moreover, the intensity estimation task is the key to understand and forecast the behavior of TCs better. Recently, the task has begun to attract attention from not only meteorologists but also data scientists. Nevertheless, it is hard to stimulate joint research between both types of scholars without a benchmark dataset to work on together. In this work, we release a such a benchmark dataset, which is a new open dataset collected from satellite remote sensing, for the TC-image-to-intensity estimation task. We also propose a novel model to solve this task based on the convolutional neural network (CNN). We discover that the usual CNN, which is mature for object recognition, requires several modifications when being used for the intensity estimation task. Furthermore, we combine the domain knowledge of meteorologists, such as the rotation-invariance of TCs, into our model design to reach better performance. Experimental results on the released benchmark dataset verify that the proposed model is among the most accurate models that can be used for TC intensity estimation, while being relatively more stable across all situations. The results demonstrate the potential of applying data science for meteorology study."

Latent factor model aims to learn user and item latent factors from user-item historic behaviors. To apply it into real big data scenarios, efficiency becomes the first concern, including offline model training efficiency and online recommendation efficiency. In this paper, we propose a D istributed C ollaborative H ashing ( DCH ) model which can significantly improve both efficiencies. Specifically, we first propose a distributed learning framework, following the state-of-the-art parameter server paradigm, to learn the offline collaborative model. Our model can be learnt efficiently by distributedly computing subgradients in minibatches on workers and updating model parameters on servers asynchronously. We then adopt hashing technique to speedup the online recommendation procedure. Recommendation can be quickly made through exploiting lookup hash tables. We conduct thorough experiments on two real large-scale datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that, comparing with the classic and state-of-the-art (distributed) latent factor models, DCH has comparable performance in terms of recommendation accuracy but has both fast convergence speed in offline model training procedure and realtime efficiency in online recommendation procedure. Furthermore, the encouraging performance of DCH is also shown for several real-world applications in Ant Financial."

Han, Di Niu, Dong Liu, Kunfeng Lai, Chenglin Wu, ","Short Text Matching plays an important role in many natural language processing tasks such as information retrieval, question answering, and conversational system. Conventional text matching methods rely on predefined templates and rules, which are not applicable to short text with limited numebr of words and limit their ability to generalize to unobserved data. Many recent efforts have been made to apply deep neural network models to natural language processing tasks, which reduces the cost of feature engineering. In this paper, we present the design of Multi-Channel Information Crossing , a multi-channel convolutional neural network model for text matching, with additional attention mechanisms from sentence and text semantics. MIX compares text snippets at varied granularities to form a series of multi-channel similarity matrices, which are crossed with another set of carefully designed attention matrices to expose the rich structures of sentences to deep neural networks. We implemented MIX and deployed the system on Tencent's Venus distributed computation platform. Thanks to carefully engineered multi-channel information crossing, evaluation results suggest that MIX outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art deep neural network models by at least 11.1% in terms of the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG@3), on the English WikiQA dataset. Moreover, we also performed online A/B tests with real users on the search service of Tencent QQ Browser. Results suggest that MIX raised the number of clicks on the returned results by 5.7%, due to an increased accuracy in query-document matching, which demonstrates the superior performance of MIX in production environments."

The compensation insights are provided based on data collected from LinkedIn members and aggregated in a privacy-preserving manner. Given the simultaneous desire for computing robust, reliable insights and for having insights to satisfy as many job seekers as possible, a key challenge is to reliably infer the insights at the company level when there is limited or no data at all. We propose a two-step framework that utilizes a novel, semantic representation of companies (Company2vec) and a Bayesian statistical model to address this problem. Our approach makes use of the rich information present in the LinkedIn Economic Graph, and in particular, uses the intuition that two companies are likely to be similar if employees are very likely to transition from one company to the other and vice versa. We compute embeddings for companies by analyzing the LinkedIn members' company transition data using machine learning algorithms, then compute pairwise similarities between companies based on these embeddings, and finally incorporate company similarities in the form of peer company groups as part of the proposed Bayesian statistical model to predict insights at the company level. We perform extensive validation using several different evaluation techniques, and show that we can significantly increase the coverage of insights while, in fact, even slightly improving the quality of the obtained insights. For example, we were able to compute salary insights for 35 times as many title-region-company combinations in the U.S. as compared to previous work, corresponding to 4.9 times as many monthly active users. Finally, we highlight the lessons learned from practical deployment of our system."

Embedding technique is a popular research topic in recent years which aims to represent any data into low-dimensional vector space, which is widely used in different data types and have multiple applications. Generating embeddings on such data in a high-speed way is a challenging problem to consider the high dynamics and the recency sensitiveness together with both effectiveness and efficient. Popular embedding methods are usually time-consuming. As well as the common optimization methods are limited since it may not have enough time to converge or deal with recency-sensitive sample weights. This problem is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization method named Diffused Stochastic Gradient Descent for such highly-dynamic and recency-sensitive data. The notion of our idea is to assign recency-sensitive weights to different samples, and select samples according to their weights in calculating gradients. And after updating the embedding of the selected sample, the related samples are also updated in a diffusion strategy. We propose a Nested Segment Tree to improve the recency-sensitive weight method and the diffusion strategy into a complexity no slower than the iteration step in practice. We also theoretically prove the convergence rate of D-SGD for independent data samples, and empirically prove the efficacy of D-SGD in large-scale real datasets."

Chi, ","Recommendation systems, prevalent in many applications, aim to surface to users the right content at the right time. Recently, researchers have aspired to develop conversational systems that offer seamless interactions with users, more effectively eliciting user preferences and offering better recommendations. Taking a step towards this goal, this paper explores the two stages of a single round of conversation with a user: which question to ask the user, and how to use their feedback to respond with a more accurate recommendation. Following these two stages, first, we detail an RNN-based model for generating topics a user might be interested in, and then extend a state-of-the-art RNN-based video recommender to incorporate the user's selected topic. We describe our proposed system Q&R, i.e., Question & Recommendation, and the surrogate tasks we utilize to bootstrap data for training our models. We evaluate different components of Q&R on live traffic in various applications within YouTube: User Onboarding, Homepage Recommendation, and Notifications. Our results demonstrate that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art recommendation models, including RNNs, and makes these applications more useful, such as a >1% increase in video notifications opened. Further, our design choices can be useful to practitioners wanting to transition to more conversational recommendation systems."

Chau, Nathan Herrmann, Krista L. Lanctôt, ","Assessment of apathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) relies heavily on interviews with caregivers and patients, which can be ambiguous and time consuming. More precise and objective methods of evaluation can better inform treatment decisions. In this study, visual scanning behaviours (VSBs) on emotional and non-emotional stimuli were used to detect apathy in patients with AD. Forty-eight AD patients participated in the study. Sixteen of the patients were apathetic. Patients looked at 48 slides with non-emotional images and 32 slides with emotional images. We described two methods that use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn differences between the VSBs of apathetic and non-apathetic AD patients. Method 1 uses two separate RNNs to learn group differences between visual scanning sequences on emotional and non-emotional stimuli. The outputs of the RNNs are then combined and used by a logistic regression classifier to characterise patients as either apathetic or non-apathetic. Method 1 achieved an AUC gain of 0.074 compared to a previously presented handcrafted feature method of detecting emotional blunting (AUC handcrafted = 0.646). Method 2 assumes that each individual's ""style of scanning"" (stereotypical eye movements) is independent of the content of the visual stimuli and uses the ""style of scanning"" to normalise the individual's VSBs on emotional and non-emotional stimuli. Method 2 uses RNNs in a sequence-to-sequence configuration to learn the individual's ""style of scanning"". The trained model is then used to create vector representations that contain information on the individual's ""style of scanning"" (content independent) and her/his VSBs (content dependent) on emotional and non-emotional stimuli. The distance between these vector representations is used by a logistic regression classifier to characterise patients as either apathetic or non-apathetic. Using Method 2 the AUC of the classifier improved to 0.814. The results presented suggest that using RNNs to analyse differences between VSBs on emotional and non-emotional stimuli (a measure of emotional blunting) can improve objective detection of apathy in individual patients with AD."

We propose the use of Web browsing history as a new indicator of candidate preference among the electorate, one that has potential to overcome a number of the drawbacks of election polls. However, there are a number of challenges that must be overcome to effectively use Web browsing for assessing candidate preference - including the lack of suitable ground truth data and the heterogeneity of user populations in time and space. We address these challenges, and show that the resulting methods can shed considerable light on the dynamics of voters' candidate preferences in ways that are difficult to achieve using polls."

This is useful for organizing content, extracting structured data from textual documents, and in machine learning relevance applications like semantic search, knowledge graph construction, and question answering. Traditionally, this work has focused on text that has been well-formed, like news articles, but in common real world datasets such as messaging, resumes, or short-form social media, non-grammatical, loosely-structured text adds a new dimension to this problem. This paper presents Pangloss, a production system for entity disambiguation on noisy text. Pangloss combines a probabilistic linear-time key phrase identification algorithm with a semantic similarity engine based on context-dependent document embeddings to achieve better than state-of-the-art results (>5% in F1) compared to other research or commercially available systems. In addition, Pangloss leverages a local embedded database with a tiered architecture to house its statistics and metadata, which allows rapid disambiguation in streaming contexts and on-device disambiguation in low-memory environments such as mobile phones."

The purpose is to provide assistance to prawn pond farmers in monitoring pond water quality with limited data. Obtaining sufficient water quality data is generally a challenge in commercial prawn farming applications. Farmers can sustain large losses in their crop if water quality is not well managed. The model presented provides a means for modelling and forecasting various water quality parameters. It is inspired by data dynamics and does not rely on physical ecosystem modelling. The model is constructed within the Bayesian filtering framework. The Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filer are applied for inference. The results demonstrate generalisability to both variables and environments. The ability for short term forecasting with mean absolute percentage errors between 0.5% and 11% is demonstrated.

To target the right audience, advertisers usually have two options: a) market research to identify user segments of interest and b) sophisticated machine learning models trained on data from past campaigns. In this paper we study how demand-side platforms (DSPs) can leverage the data they collect (demographic and behavioral) in order to learn reputation signals about end user convertibility and advertisement (ad) quality. In particular, we propose a reputation system which learns interest scores about end users, as an additional signal of ad conversion, and quality scores about ads, as a signal of campaign success. Then our model builds user segments based on a combination of demographic, behavioral and the new reputation signals and recommends transparent targeting rules that are easy for the advertiser to interpret and refine. We perform an experimental evaluation on industry data that showcases the benefits of our approach for both new and existing advertiser campaigns."

This underscores the urgent need for practical defense techniques that can be readily deployed to combat attacks in real-time. Observing that many attack strategies aim to perturb image pixels in ways that are visually imperceptible, we place JPEG compression at the core of our proposed SHIELD defense framework, utilizing its capability to effectively ""compress away"" such pixel manipulation. To immunize a DNN model from artifacts introduced by compression, SHIELD ""vaccinates"" the model by retraining it with compressed images, where different compression levels are applied to generate multiple vaccinated models that are ultimately used together in an ensemble defense. On top of that, SHIELD adds an additional layer of protection by employing randomization at test time that compresses different regions of an image using random compression levels, making it harder for an adversary to estimate the transformation performed. This novel combination of vaccination, ensembling, and randomization makes SHIELD a fortified multi-pronged defense. We conducted extensive, large-scale experiments using the ImageNet dataset, and show that our approaches eliminate up to 98% of gray-box attacks delivered by strong adversarial techniques such as Carlini-Wagner's L2 attack and DeepFool. Our approaches are fast and work without requiring knowledge about the model."

This method offers a non-subscribed reader a fixed number of free articles in a period of time (e.g., a month), and then directs the user to the subscription page for further reading. We argue that there is no direct relationship between the number of paywalls presented to readers and the number of subscriptions, and that this artificial barrier, if not used well, may disengage potential subscribers and thus may not well serve its purpose of increasing revenue. Moreover, the current paywall mechanism neither considers the user browsing history nor the potential articles which the user may visit in the future. Thus, it treats all readers equally and does not consider the potential of a reader in becoming a subscriber. In this paper, we propose an adaptive paywall mechanism to balance the benefit of showing an article against that of displaying the paywall (i.e., terminating the session). We first define the notion of cost and utility that are used to define an objective function for optimal paywall decision making. Then, we model the problem as a stochastic sequential decision process. Finally, we propose an efficient policy function for paywall decision making. The experimental results on a real dataset from a major newspaper in Canada show that the proposed model outperforms the traditional paywall mechanism as well as the other baselines."

The teams are becoming increasingly interested in exploiting these data to gain a competitive advantage over their competitors. One of the most prevalent types of new data is event stream data from matches. These data enable more advanced descriptive analysis as well as the potential to investigate an opponent's tactics in greater depth. Due to the complexity of both the data and game strategy, most tactical analyses are currently performed by humans reviewing video and scouting matches in person. As a result, this is a time-consuming and tedious process. This paper explores the problem of automatic tactics detection from event-stream data collected from professional soccer matches. We highlight several important challenges that these data and this problem setting pose. We describe a data-driven approach for identifying patterns of movement that account for both spatial and temporal information which represent potential offensive tactics. We evaluate our approach on the 2015/2016 season of the English Premier League and are able to identify interesting strategies per team related to goal kicks, corners and set pieces."

To combat the evolving malware attacks, in this paper, we first study how to utilize both content- and relation-based features to characterize sly malware; to model different types of entities (i.e., file, archive, machine, API, DLL ) and the rich semantic relationships among them (i.e., file-archive, file-machine, file-file, API-DLL, file-API relations), we then construct a structural heterogeneous information network (HIN) and present meta-graph based approach to depict the relatedness over files. To measure the relatedness over files on the constructed HIN, since malware detection is a cost-sensitive task, it calls for efficient methods to learn latent representations for HIN. To address this challenge, based on the built meta-graph schemes, we propose a new HIN embedding model metagraph2vec on the first attempt to learn the low-dimensional representations for the nodes in HIN, where both the HIN structures and semantics are maximally preserved for malware detection. A comprehensive experimental study on the real sample collections from Comodo Cloud Security Center is performed to compare various malware detection approaches. The promising experimental results demonstrate that our developed system Scorpion which integrate our proposed method outperforms other alternative malware detection techniques.

We propose an original approach based on character segmentation. Our solution is able to deal with the dirty segmentation that inevitably occurs in handwritten documents. We use a convolutional neural network to recognize characters, and statistical language models to compose word transcriptions. Our approach requires minimal training effort, making the transcription process more scalable, as the production of training sets requires a few pages and can be easily crowdsourced. We have conducted experiments on manuscripts from the Vatican Registers, an unreleased corpus containing the correspondence of the popes.

Learning to rank (LTR) methods have been widely applied to ranking problems. However, such methods often consider different ranking steps in a session to be independent, which conversely may be highly correlated to each other. For better utilizing the correlation between different ranking steps, in this paper, we propose to use reinforcement learning (RL) to learn an optimal ranking policy which maximizes the expected accumulative rewards in a search session. Firstly, we formally define the concept of search session Markov decision process (SSMDP) to formulate the multi-step ranking problem. Secondly, we analyze the property of SSMDP and theoretically prove the necessity of maximizing accumulative rewards. Lastly, we propose a novel policy gradient algorithm for learning an optimal ranking policy, which is able to deal with the problem of high reward variance and unbalanced reward distribution of an SSMDP.

In this paper, we focus on predicting the hourly demand for demand rentals and returns at each station of the system. The proposed model uses temporal and weather features to predict demand mean and variance. It first extracts the main traffic behaviors from the stations. These simplified behaviors are then predicted and used to perform station-level predictions based on machine learning and statistical inference techniques.

Further, it compares them with similar homes in a given population using widely available datasets. WattHome also incorporates a fault detection algorithm to identify the underlying causes of energy inefficiency. We validate our approach using ground truth data from different geographical locations, which showcases its applicability in different settings. Moreover, we present results from a case study from a city containing >10,000 buildings and show that more than half of the buildings are inefficient in one way or another indicating a significant potential from energy improvement measures.

Analyzing safety incidents using operational data and producing event-based explanations is invaluable to airline companies as well as to governing organizations such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States. However, this task is challenging because of the complexity involved in mining multi-dimensional heterogeneous time series data, the lack of time-step-wise annotation of events in a flight, and the lack of scalable tools to perform analysis over a large number of events. In this work, we propose a precursor mining algorithm that identifies events in the multidimensional time series that are correlated with the safety incident. Precursors are valuable to systems health and safety monitoring and in explaining and forecasting safety incidents. Current methods suffer from poor scalability to high dimensional time series data and are inefficient in capturing temporal behavior. We propose an approach by combining multiple-instance learning (MIL) and deep recurrent neural networks (DRNN) to take advantage of MIL's ability to learn using weakly supervised data and DRNN's ability to model temporal behavior.

Multiple auction platforms, also called Supply-Side Platforms (SSP), were created. Because of this multiplicity, publishers started to create competition between SSPs. In this setting, there are two successive auctions: a second price auction in each SSP and a secondary, first price auction, called header bidding auction, between SSPs. In this paper, we consider an SSP competing with other SSPs for ad spaces. The SSP acts as an intermediary between an advertiser wanting to buy ad spaces and a web publisher wanting to sell its ad spaces, and needs to define a bidding strategy to be able to deliver to the advertisers as many ads as possible while spending as little as possible. The revenue optimization of this SSP can be written as a contextual bandit problem, where the context consists of the information available about the ad opportunity, such as properties of the internet user or of the ad placement. Using classical multi-armed bandit strategies (such as the original versions of UCB and EXP3) is inefficient in this setting and yields a low convergence speed, as the arms are very correlated. In this paper we design and experiment a version of the Thompson Sampling algorithm that easily takes this correlation into account. We combine this bayesian algorithm with a particle filter, which permits to handle non-stationarity by sequentially estimating the distribution of the highest bid to beat in order to win an auction. We apply this methodology on two real auction datasets, and show that it significantly outperforms more classical approaches. The strategy defined in this paper is being developed to be deployed on thousands of publishers worldwide."

This is evident from usage pattern of a conversational system deployed within our organization. Users not only expect it to perform co-reference resolution of anaphora, but also of the antecedent or posterior facts presented by users with respect to their query. Presence of such facts in a conversation sometimes modifies the answer of main query, e.g., answer to 'how many sick leave do I get?' would be different when a fact 'I am on contract' is also present. Sometimes there is a need to collectively resolve three or four such facts. In this paper, we propose a novel solution which uses hierarchical neural network, comprising of BiLSTM layer and a maxpool layer that is hierarchically stacked to first obtain a representation of each user utterance and then to obtain a representation for sequence of utterances. This representation is used to identify users' intention. We also improvise this model by using skip connections in the second network to allow better gradient flow. Our model, not only a)~resolves the antecedent and posterior facts, but also b)~performs better even on self-contained queries. It is also c)~faster to train, making it the most promising approach for use in our environment where frequent training and tuning is needed.

The hyperparameters usually drive both the efficiency of the model training process and the resulting model quality. For hyperparameter tuning, machine learning algorithms are complex black-boxes. This creates a class of challenging optimization problems, whose objective functions tend to be nonsmooth, discontinuous, unpredictably varying in computational expense, and include continuous, categorical, and/or integer variables. Further, function evaluations can fail for a variety of reasons including numerical difficulties or hardware failures. Additionally, not all hyperparameter value combinations are compatible, which creates so called hidden constraints. Robust and efficient optimization algorithms are needed for hyperparameter tuning. In this paper we present an automated parallel derivative-free optimization framework called Autotune , which combines a number of specialized sampling and search methods that are very effective in tuning machine learning models despite these challenges. Autotune provides significantly improved models over using default hyperparameter settings with minimal user interaction on real-world applications. Given the inherent expense of training numerous candidate models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Autotune's search methods and the efficient distributed and parallel paradigms for training and tuning models, and also discuss the resource trade-offs associated with the ability to both distribute the training process and parallelize the tuning process."

When making hiring decisions in these markets, employers have to assess a large and heterogeneous population of contractors. Because many of the contractors' characteristics are latent, employers often make risky decisions that end up in negative outcomes. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a framework for recommending contractors who are likely to get hired and successfully complete the task at hand. We start our analysis by acknowledging that employers' hiring behavior dynamically evolves with time; Employers learn to choose contractors according to the outcomes of their previously completed tasks. To capture this dynamic evolution, we propose a structured Hidden Markov Model that explicitly models task outcomes through the employers' evolution. We build and evaluate the proposed framework on a dataset of real online hiring decisions.

Recent work has shown that existing structural alerts are not up to the task of identifying PAINS. To address this short-coming, we are in the process of developing a tool, PrePeP, that predicts PAINS, and allows experts to visually explore the reasons for the prediction. In the paper, we discuss the different aspects that are involved in developing a functional tool: systematically deriving structural descriptors, addressing the extreme imbalance of the data, offering visual information that pharmacological chemists are familiar with. We evaluate the quality of the approach using benchmark data sets from the literature and show that we correct several short-comings of existing PAINS alerts that have recently been pointed out."

Ali Vanderveld, ","Water infrastructure in the United States is beginning to show its age, particularly through water main breaks. Main breaks cause major disruptions in everyday life for residents and businesses. Water main failures in Syracuse, N.Y. (as in most cities) are handled reactively rather than proactively. A barrier to proactive maintenance with limited resources is the city's inability to properly prioritize the allocation of its resources. We built a Machine Learning system to assess the risk of a water mains breaking. Using historical data on which mains have failed, descriptors of pipes, and other data sources, we evaluated several models' abilities to predict breaks three years into the future. Our results show that our system using gradient boosted decision trees performed best out of several algorithms and expert heuristics, achieving precision at 1% (P@1) of 0.62. Our model outperforms a random baseline (P@1 of 0.08) and expert heuristics such as water main age (P@1 of 0.10) and history of past main breaks (P@1 of 0.48). The model is currently deployed in the City of Syracuse. We are conducting a pilot by calculating the risk of failure for each city block over the period 2016-2018 using data up to the end of 2015 and, as of the end of 2017, there have been 42 breaks on our riskiest 52 mains. This has been a successful initiative for the city of Syracuse in improving its infrastructure and we believe this approach can be applied to other cities."

By applying the trained generator, we can generate keywords directly from a given query, so that we can highly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of query-keyword matching based ads selection in search advertising.

TATC is a multivariate time series classification method using a neural attention-based deep learning approach. It not only performs accurate prediction of AD risk, but also generates meaningful interpretation of daily behavior pattern of subjects.

To enable interactive identification of insights, a large number of dimension combinations need to be searched and a series of aggregation queries need to be quickly answered. The existing approaches answer interactive queries on big data through data cubes or approximate query processing. However, these approaches can hardly satisfy the performance or accuracy requirements for ad-hoc queries demanded by interactive exploration. In this paper, we present BigIN4, a system for instant, interactive identification of insights from multi-dimensional big data. BigIN4 gives insight suggestions by enumerating subspaces and answers queries by combining data cube and approximate query processing techniques. If a query cannot be answered by the cubes, BigIN4 decomposes it into several low dimensional queries that can be directly answered by the cubes through an online constructed Bayesian Network and gives an approximate answer within a statistical interval. Unlike the related works, BigIN4 does not require any prior knowledge of queries and does not assume a certain data distribution. Our experiments on ten real-world large-scale datasets show that BigIN4 can successfully identify insights from big data. Furthermore, BigIN4 can provide approximate answers to aggregation queries effectively (with less than 10% error on average) and efficiently (50x faster than sampling-based methods)."

Unfortunately, estimates indicated that between 29% to 79% of runners sustain an overuse injury every year. One contributing factor to such injuries is excessive fatigue, which can result in alterations in how someone runs that increase the risk for an overuse injury. Thus being able to detect during a running session when excessive fatigue sets in, and hence when these alterations are prone to arise, could be of great practical importance. In this paper, we explore whether we can use machine learning to predict the rating of perceived exertion (RPE), a validated subjective measure of fatigue, from inertial sensor data of individuals running outdoors. We describe how both the subjective target label and the realistic outdoor running environment introduce several interesting data science challenges.

Rule-based POS tagging is a wellknown solution, which assigns tags to the words using a set of predefined rules. Many researchers favor statistical-based approaches over rule-based methods for better empirical accuracy. However, until now, the computational cost of rule-based POS tagging has made it difficult to study whether more complex rules or larger rulesets could lead to accuracy competitive with statistical approaches. In this paper, we leverage two hardware accelerators, the Automata Processor (AP) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), to accelerate rule-based POS tagging by converting rules to regular expressions and exploiting the highly-parallel regular-expressionmatching ability of these accelerators. We study the relationship between rule set size and accuracy, and observe that adding more rules only poses minimal overhead on the AP and FPGA. This allows a substantial increase in the number and complexity of rules, leading to accuracy improvement. Our experiments on Treebank and Brown corpora achieve up to 2,600X and 1,914X speedups on the AP and on the FPGA respectively over rule-based methods on the CPU in the rule-matching stage, up to 58× speedup over the Perceptron POS tagger on the CPU in total testing time, and up to 253× speedup over the LSTM tagger on the GPU in total testing time, while showing a competitive accuracy compared to neural-network and statistical solutions."

The introduction of the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) significantly reduces the efforts of feature engineering so that supervised learning becomes even more automated. The last bottleneck is to ensure the data quality, particularly the label quality, because the performance of supervised learning is bounded by the errors present in labels. In this paper, we present a new Active Deep Denoising (ADD) approach that first builds a DNN noise model, and then adopts an active learning algorithm to identify the optimal denoising function. We prove that under the low noise condition, we only need to query the oracle with log n examples where n is the total number in the data.

We analyze stochastic dynamic pricing models in competitive markets with multiple offer dimensions, such as price, quality, and rating. In a first step, we use a simulated test market to study how sales probabilities are affected by specific customer behaviors and the strategic interaction of price reaction strategies. Further, we show how different state-of-the-art learning techniques can be used to estimate sales probabilities from partially observable market data. In a second step, we use a dynamic programming model to compute an effective pricing strategy which circumvents the curse of dimensionality. We demonstrate that the strategy is applicable even if the number of competitors is large and their strategies are unknown. We show that our heuristic can be tuned to smoothly balance profitability and speed of sales. Further, our approach is currently applied by a large seller on Amazon for the sale of used books.

In particular paroxysmal AF is a form of AF that occurs occasionally, and has a higher probability of being undetected. In this work, we present an attention based deep learning framework for detection of paroxysmal AF episodes from a sequence of windows. Time-frequency representation of 30 seconds recording windows, over a 10 minute data segment, are fed sequentially into a deep convolutional neural network for image-based feature extraction, which are then presented to a bidirectional recurrent neural network with an attention layer for AF detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for transient AF detection, we use a database of 24 hour Holter Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings acquired from 2850 patients at the University of Virginia heart station. The algorithm achieves an AUC of 0.94 on the testing set, which exceeds the performance of baseline models. We also demonstrate the cross-domain generalizablity of the approach by adapting the learned model parameters from one recording modality (ECG) to another (photoplethysmogram) with improved AF detection performance.

Mobility event prediction is of utmost importance in the field of intelligent transportation systems. It has a huge potential in solving important problems such as minimizing passenger waiting time and maximizing the utilization of the transportation resources by planning vehicle routes and dispatching transportation resources. Recently, numerous mobility pattern mining methods have been proposed to predict the transportation supply and demand in different locations. Those methods first reveal the event patterns of each Place of Interests (POI) independently and then employ a separate region function as a post-processing step. This separate process, that disregards the intrinsic spatial and temporal pattern correlations between POI, is sub-optimal and complex, resulting in a poor generalization in different scenarios. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Temporal mobility Event Prediction framework based on Deep neural network (StepDeep) for simultaneously taking into account all correlated spatial and temporal mobility patterns. StepDeep not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances the prediction accuracy. Our StepDeep proposes a novel problem formulation towards an end-to-end mobility prediction framework, that is, switching mobility events over time in an area into an event video and then posing the mobility prediction problem as a video prediction task. Such a novel formulation can naturally encode spatial and temporal dependencies for each POI. StepDeep thus predicts the spatial-temporal events by incorporating the new time sensitive convolution filters, spatial sensitive convolution filters, and spatial-temporal sensitive convolution filters into a single network. We conduct experimental evaluations on a real-world 547-day New York City taxi trajectory dataset, which show that StepDeep provides higher prediction accuracy than five existing baselines. Moreover, StepDeep is generalizable and can be applied to numerous spatial-temporal event prediction scenarios."

We describe how the design of the system was informed by three key principles: scaling to a planet-wide email service, isolating the complexity to provide a simple experience for the developer, and safeguarding the privacy of users (our team and the developers we support are not allowed to view any single email). We describe the design tradeoffs made in building this system, the challenges faced and the approaches used to tackle them. We present case studies of three extraction tasks implemented on this platform---bill reminders, commercial offers, and hotel reservations---to illustrate the effectiveness of the platform despite challenges unique to each task. Finally, we outline several areas of ongoing research in large-scale machine-learned information extraction from email."

Employing sophisticated targeting criteria reliably increases the performance of an ad campaign, however too strict criteria will limit its scale. This raises the need to estimate the number of anticipated ad impressions at a given campaign performance level, thus enabling advertisers to tune the campaign's budget to an optimal performance-scale trade-off. In this paper, we provide a way to estimate campaign impressions given the campaign criteria. There are several challenges to this problem. First, the criteria contain logic to include and exclude combinations of audience segments, making the space of possible criteria exponentially large. Furthermore, it is difficult to validate predictions, because we wish to predict the number of impressions available without budget constraints, a situation we can rarely observe in practice. In our approach, we first treat the audience segment inclusion/exclusion criteria separately as a data compression problem, where we use MinHash ""sketches"" to estimate audience size. We then model the number of available impressions with a regularized linear regression in log space, using multiplier features motivated by the assumption that some components of the additional campaign criteria are conditionally independent. We construct a validation set by projecting observed RTB data (under real budget constraints) to get impression availability without budget constraints. Using this approach, our average prediction is a factor of 2.2 from the true impression availability, and the deployed product responds to user requests in well under a second, meeting both accuracy and latency requirements for decision making in the execution of advertising campaigns."

Surplus food, which could be used to feed people facing food insecurity, is instead discarded and placed in landfills. Institutions, universities, and non-profits have noticed this issue and are beginning to take action to reduce surplus food waste, typically by redirecting it to food banks and other organizations or having students transport or eat the food. These approaches present challenges such as transportation, volunteer availability, and lack of prioritization of those in need. In this paper, we introduce PittGrub, a notification system to intelligently select users to invite to events that have leftover food. PittGrub was invented to help reduce food waste at the University of Pittsburgh. We use reinforcement learning to determine how many notifications to send out and a valuation model to determine whom to prioritize in the notifications. Our goal is to produce a system that prioritizes feeding students in need while simultaneously eliminating food waste and maintaining a fair distribution of notifications. As far as we are aware, PittGrub is unique in its approach to eliminating surplus food waste while striving for social good. We compare our proposed techniques to multiple baselines on simulated datasets to demonstrate effectiveness. Experimental results among various algorithms show promise in eliminating food waste while helping those facing food insecurity and treating users fairly. Our prototype is currently in beta and coming soon to the Apple App Store."

To address this resource gap, prior work has developed machine learning frameworks to predict fire risk and prioritize fire inspections. However, existing approaches were limited by not including time-varying data, never deploying in real-time, and only predicting risk for a small subset of commercial properties in their city. Here, we have developed a predictive risk framework for all 20,636 commercial properties in Pittsburgh, based on time-varying data from a variety of municipal agencies. We have deployed our fire risk model on Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire's (PBF), and we have developed preliminary risk models for residential property fire risk prediction. Our commercial risk model outperforms the prior state of the art with a kappa of 0.33 compared to their 0.17, and is able to be applied to nearly 4 times as many properties as the prior model. In the 5 weeks since our model was first deployed, 58% of our predicted high-risk properties had a fire incident of any kind, while 23% of the building fire incidents that occurred took place in our predicted high or medium risk properties. The risk scores from our commercial model are visualized on an interactive dashboard and map to assist the PBF with planning their fire risk reduction initiatives. This work is already helping to improve fire risk reduction in Pittsburgh and is beginning to be adopted by other cities."

Consequently, there is a great need for systems that can ingest these documents at scale and make the contained knowledge discoverable. Unfortunately, both the format of these documents (e.g. the PDF format or bitmap images) as well as the presentation of the data (e.g. complex tables) make the extraction of qualitative and quantitive data extremely challenging. In this paper, we present a modular, cloud-based platform to ingest documents at scale. This platform, called the Corpus Conversion Service (CCS), implements a pipeline which allows users to parse and annotate documents (i.e. collect ground-truth), train machine-learning classification algorithms and ultimately convert any type of PDF or bitmap-documents to a structured content representation format. We will show that each of the modules is scalable due to an asynchronous microservice architecture and can therefore handle massive amounts of documents. Furthermore, we will show that our capability to gather groundtruth is accelerated by machine-learning algorithms by at least one order of magnitude. This allows us to both gather large amounts of ground-truth in very little time and obtain very good precision/recall metrics in the range of 99% with regard to content conversion to structured output. The CCS platform is currently deployed on IBM internal infrastructure and serving more than 250 active users for knowledge-engineering project engagements."

However, the VF test is time-consuming, costly, and noisy. Using retinal thickness (RT) for glaucoma diagnosis is currently desirable. Thus, we propose a new methodology for estimating VF from RT in glaucomatous eyes. The key ideas are to use our new methods of pattern-based regularization (PBR) and pattern-based visualization (PBV) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). PBR effectively conducts supervised learning of RT-VF relations in combination with unsupervised learning from non-paired VF data. We can thereby avoid overfitting of a CNN to small sized data. PBV visualizes functional correspondence between RT and VF with its nonlinearity preserved. We empirically demonstrate with real datasets that a CNN with PBR achieves the highest estimation accuracy to date and that a CNN with PBV is effective for knowledge discovery in an ophthalmological context."

Recently many deep learning based predicted models are also developed for EHR data and demonstrated impressive performance. However, a series of recent studies showed that these deep models are not safe: they suffer from certain vulnerabilities. In short, a well-trained deep network can be extremely sensitive to inputs with negligible changes. These inputs are referred to as adversarial examples. In the context of medical informatics, such attacks could alter the result of a high performance deep predictive model by slightly perturbing a patient's medical records. Such instability not only reflects the weakness of deep architectures, more importantly, it offers a guide on detecting susceptible parts on the inputs. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective framework that learns a time-preferential minimum attack targeting the LSTM model with EHR inputs, and we leverage this attack strategy to screen medical records of patients and identify susceptible events and measurements. The efficient screening procedure can assist decision makers to pay extra attentions to the locations that can cause severe consequence if not measured correctly. We conduct extensive empirical studies on a real-world urgent care cohort and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed screening."

These models are often developed and evaluated on datasets with heterogeneous patient populations. However, good predictive performance on the aggregate population does not imply good performance for specific groups. In this work, we present a two-step framework to 1) learn relevant patient subgroups, and 2) predict an outcome for separate patient populations in a multi-task framework, where each population is a separate task. We demonstrate how to discover relevant groups in an unsupervised way with a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder. We show that using these groups in a multi-task framework leads to better predictive performance of in-hospital mortality both across groups and overall. We also highlight the need for more granular evaluation of performance when dealing with heterogeneous populations."

Therefore, game bot detection becomes particularly important and urgent. Among many kinds of online games, massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs), such as World of Warcraft and AION, provide immersive gaming experience and attract many loyal fans. At the same time, however, game bots in MMORPGs have proliferated in volume and method, evolving with the real-world detection methods and showing strong diversity, leaving MMORPG bot detection efforts extremely difficult. To deal with the fast-changing nature of game bots, we here proposed a generalized game bot detection framework for MMORPGs termed NGUARD, denoting NetEase Games' Guard. NGUARD takes charge of automatically differentiating game bots from humans for MMORPGs. In detail, NGUARD exploits a combination of supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised models are utilized to detect game bots in observed patterns according to the training data. Meanwhile, unsupervised solutions are employed to detect clustered game bots and help discovering new bots. The game bot detection framework NGUARD has been implemented and deployed in multiple MMORPG productions in the NetEase Game portfolio, achieving remarkable performance improvement and acceleration compared to traditional methods. Moreover, the framework reveals outstanding robustness for game bots in mutated patterns and even in completely new patterns on account of the design of the auto-iteration mechanism."

An efficiency regression is characterized by instances where the CPU utilization or query per second (QPS) patterns of a function or endpoint experience an unexpected increase over its prior baseline. If the code changes responsible for these regressions get propagated to Facebook's fleet of web servers, the impact of the inefficient code will get compounded over billions of executions per day, carrying potential ramifications to Facebook's scaling efforts and the quality of the user experience. With a codebase ingesting in excess of 1,000 diffs across multiple pushes per day, it is important to have a real-time solution for detecting regressions that is not only scalable and high in recall, but also highly precise in order to avoid overrunning the remediation queue with thousands of false positives. This paper describes the end-to-end regression detection system designed and used at Facebook. The main detection algorithm is based on sequential statistics supplemented by signal processing transformations, and the performance of the algorithm was assessed with a mixture of online and offline tests across different use cases. We compare the performance of our algorithm against a simple benchmark as well as a commercial anomaly detection software solution."

Understanding the propagation in large-scale metapopulations and predicting the future outbreaks thus become crucially important for epidemic control and prevention. In the literature, there have been a bulk of studies on modeling intra-city epidemic propagation but with the single population assumption (homogeneity). Some recent works on metapopulation propagation, however, focus on finding specific human mobility physical networks to approximate diseases transmission networks, whose generality to fit different diseases cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we argue that the intra-city epidemic propagation should be modeled on a metapopulation base, and propose a two-step method for this purpose. The first step is to understand the propagation system by inferring the underlying disease infection network. To this end, we propose a novel network inference model called D 2 PRI, which reduces the individual network into a sub-population network without information loss, and incorporates the power-law distribution prior and data prior for better performance. The second step is to predict the disease propagation by extending the classic SIR model to a metapopulation SIR model that allows visitors transmission between any two sub-populations. The validity of our model is testified on a real-life clinical report data set about the airborne disease in the Shenzhen city, China. The D 2 PRI model with the extended SIR model exhibit superior performance in various tasks including network inference, infection prediction and outbreaks simulation."

There are three major challenges facing RS in Taobao: scalability, sparsity and cold start. In this paper, we present our technical solutions to address these three challenges. The methods are based on a well-known graph embedding framework. We first construct an item graph from users' behavior history, and learn the embeddings of all items in the graph. The item embeddings are employed to compute pairwise similarities between all items, which are then used in the recommendation process. To alleviate the sparsity and cold start problems, side information is incorporated into the graph embedding framework. We propose two aggregation methods to integrate the embeddings of items and the corresponding side information. Experimental results from offline experiments show that methods incorporating side information are superior to those that do not. Further, we describe the platform upon which the embedding methods are deployed and the workflow to process the billion-scale data in Taobao. Using A/B test, we show that the online Click-Through-Rates (CTRs) are improved comparing to the previous collaborative filtering based methods widely used in Taobao, further demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed methods in Taobao's live production environment."

The fake news can take advantage of multimedia content to mislead readers and get dissemination, which can cause negative effects or even manipulate the public events. One of the unique challenges for fake news detection on social media is how to identify fake news on newly emerged events. Unfortunately, most of the existing approaches can hardly handle this challenge, since they tend to learn event-specific features that can not be transferred to unseen events. In order to address this issue, we propose an end-to-end framework named Event Adversarial Neural Network (EANN), which can derive event-invariant features and thus benefit the detection of fake news on newly arrived events. It consists of three main components: the multi-modal feature extractor, the fake news detector, and the event discriminator. The multi-modal feature extractor is responsible for extracting the textual and visual features from posts. It cooperates with the fake news detector to learn the discriminable representation for the detection of fake news. The role of event discriminator is to remove the event-specific features and keep shared features among events. Extensive experiments are conducted on multimedia datasets collected from Weibo and Twitter. The experimental results show our proposed EANN model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods, and learn transferable feature representations."

Second, we adapt different existing machine learning models to solve the regression problem. Furthermore, we propose a Wide-Deep-Recurrent (WDR) learning model to accurately predict the travel time along a given route at a given departure time. We then jointly train wide linear models, deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks together to take full advantages of all three models. We evaluate our solution offline with millions of historical vehicle travel data. We also deploy the proposed solution on Didi Chuxing's platform, which services billions of ETA requests and benefits millions of customers per day.

Given a dynamic biological graph modeling a given disease progression, which genes interact closely at the early stage of the disease, and their interactions are being disrupted in the latter stage of the disease? Which genes interact sparsely at the early stage of the disease, and their interactions increase as the disease progresses? Knowing the answers to these questions is important as they give insights to the underlying molecular mechanism to disease progression, and potential treatments that target these mechanisms can be developed. There are three main contributions to this paper. First, we designed a novel algorithm, SDREGION, that identifies subgraphs that decrease or increase in density monotonically over time, referred to as d-regions or i-regions, respectively. We introduced the objective function, -density, for identifying d-(i-)regions. Second, SDREGION is a generic algorithm, applicable across several real datasets. In this manuscript, we showed its effectiveness, and made observations in the modeling of the progression of lung cancer. In particular, we observed that SDREGION identified d-(i-)regions that capture mechanisms that align with literature. Importantly, findings that were identified but were not retrospectively validated by literature may provide novel mechanisms in tumor progression that will guide future biological experiments. Third, SDREGION is scalable with a time complexity of O(mlogn + nlogn) where m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices in a given dynamic graph."

The most commonly used A/B testing framework in many companies is based on Average Treatment Effect (ATE), which cannot detect the heterogeneity of treatment effect on users with different characteristics. In this paper, we propose statistical methods that can systematically and accurately identify Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) of any user cohort of interest (e.g. mobile device type, country), and determine which factors (e.g. age, gender) of users contribute to the heterogeneity of the treatment effect in an A/B test. By applying these methods on both simulation data and real-world experimentation data, we show how they work robustly with controlled low False Discover Rate (FDR), and at the same time, provides us with useful insights about the heterogeneity of identified user groups.

This Mobile Access Records Resolution (MARR) problem is confronted with two major challenges: (1) device identifiers and other attributes in access records might be missing or unreliable; (2) the dataset contains billions of access records from millions of devices. To the best of our knowledge, as a novel challenge industrial problem of mobile Internet, no existing method has been developed to resolve entities using mobile device identifiers in such a massive scale.

The problem is solved in a learning and planning manner: 1) based on historical data, we first summarize demand and supply patterns into a spatiotemporal quantization, each of which indicates the expected value of a driver being in a particular state; 2) a planning step is conducted in real-time, where each driver-order-pair is valued in consideration of both immediate rewards and future gains, and then dispatch is solved using a combinatorial optimizing algorithm.

In the era of big data, tree ensemble models grow large in both tree depth and ensemble size to provide even better search relevance and user experience. However, the computational cost for their scoring process is high, such that it becomes a challenging issue to apply the big tree ensemble models in a search engine which needs to answer thousands of queries per second. Although several works have been proposed to improve the scoring process, the challenge is still great especially when the model size grows large. In this paper, we present RapidScorer , a novel framework for speeding up the scoring process of industry-scale tree ensemble models, without hurting the quality of scoring results. RapidScorer introduces a modified run length encoding called epitome to the bitvector representation of the tree nodes. Epitome can greatly reduce the computation cost to traverse the tree ensemble, and work with several other proposed strategies to maximize the compactness of data units in memory. The achieved compactness makes it possible to fully utilize data parallelization to improve model scalability.

The latter network adopts a neural distributed architecture to fuse heterogeneous urban data for simultaneously capturing the factors affecting air quality, e.g. meteorological conditions. We deployed DeepAir in our AirPollutionPrediction system, providing fine-grained air quality forecasts for 300+ Chinese cities every hour. The experimental results on the data from three-year nine Chinese-city demonstrate the advantages of DeepAir beyond 10 baseline methods. Comparing with the previous online approach in AirPollutionPrediction system, we have 2.4%, 12.2%, 63.2% relative accuracy improvements on short-term, long-term and sudden changes prediction, respectively."

However, making these methods practical and scalable to web-scale recommendation tasks with billions of items and hundreds of millions of users remains an unsolved challenge. Here we describe a large-scale deep recommendation engine that we developed and deployed at Pinterest. We develop a data-efficient Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) algorithm, which combines efficient random walks and graph convolutions to generate embeddings of nodes (i.e., items) that incorporate both graph structure as well as node feature information. Compared to prior GCN approaches, we develop a novel method based on highly efficient random walks to structure the convolutions and design a novel training strategy that relies on harder-and-harder training examples to improve robustness and convergence of the model. We also develop an efficient MapReduce model inference algorithm to generate embeddings using a trained model. Overall, we can train on and embed graphs that are four orders of magnitude larger than typical GCN implementations. We show how GCN embeddings can be used to make high-quality recommendations in various settings at Pinterest, which has a massive underlying graph with 3 billion nodes representing pins and boards, and 17 billion edges. According to offline metrics, user studies, as well as A/B tests, our approach generates higher-quality recommendations than comparable deep learning based systems. To our knowledge, this is by far the largest application of deep graph embeddings to date and paves the way for a new generation of web-scale recommender systems based on graph convolutional architectures."

The problem is also challenging due to the rareness of accidents in space and time and spatial heterogeneity of the environment (e.g., urban vs. rural). Most previous research on traffic accident prediction conducted by domain researchers simply applied classical prediction models on limited data without addressing the above challenges properly, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance. A small number of recent works have attempted to use deep learning for traffic accident prediction. However, they either ignore time information or use only data from a small and homogeneous study area (a city), without handling spatial heterogeneity and temporal auto-correlation properly at the same time. In this paper we perform a comprehensive study on the traffic accident prediction problem using the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network model. A number of detailed features such as weather, environment, road condition, and traffic volume are extracted from big datasets over the state of Iowa across 8 years. To address the spatial heterogeneity challenge in the data, we propose a Hetero-ConvLSTM framework, where a few novel ideas are implemented on top of the basic ConvLSTM model, such as incorporating spatial graph features and spatial model ensemble. Extensive experiments on the 8-year data over the entire state of Iowa show that the proposed framework makes reasonably accurate predictions and significantly improves the prediction accuracy over baseline approaches."

Sponsored search (SS) auction, due to the randomness of user query behavior and platform nature, usually adopts keyword-level bidding strategies. In contrast, the display advertising (DA), as a relatively simpler scenario for auction, has taken advantage of real-time bidding (RTB) to boost the performance for advertisers. In this paper, we consider the RTB problem in sponsored search auction, named SS-RTB. SS-RTB has a much more complex dynamic environment, due to stochastic user query behavior and more complex bidding policies based on multiple keywords of an ad. Most previous methods for DA cannot be applied. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) solution for handling the complex dynamic environment. Although some RL methods have been proposed for online advertising, they all fail to address the ""environment changing'' problem: the state transition probabilities vary between two days. Motivated by the observation that auction sequences of two days share similar transition patterns at a proper aggregation level, we formulate a robust MDP model at hour-aggregation level of the auction data and propose a control-by-model framework for SS-RTB. Rather than generating bid prices directly, we decide a bidding model for impressions of each hour and perform real-time bidding accordingly. We also extend the method to handle the multi-agent problem. We deployed the SS-RTB system in the e-commerce search auction platform of Alibaba. Empirical experiments of offline evaluation and online A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

In this paper, we propose an embedding based framework to learn and transfer the representation of IDs. As the implicit feedbacks of users, a tremendous amount of item ID sequences can be easily collected from the interactive sessions. By jointly using these informative sequences and the structural connections among IDs, all types of IDs can be embedded into one low-dimensional semantic space. Subsequently, the learned representations are utilized and transferred in four scenarios: (i) measuring the similarity between items, (ii) transferring from seen items to unseen items, (iii) transferring across different domains, (iv) transferring across different tasks.

The vast majority of traditional recommender systems consider the recommendation procedure as a static process and make recommendations following a fixed strategy. In this paper, we propose a novel recommender system with the capability of continuously improving its strategies during the interactions with users. We model the sequential interactions between users and a recommender system as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automatically learn the optimal strategies via recommending trial-and-error items and receiving reinforcements of these items from users' feedback. Users' feedback can be positive and negative and both types of feedback have great potentials to boost recommendations. However, the number of negative feedback is much larger than that of positive one; thus incorporating them simultaneously is challenging since positive feedback could be buried by negative one. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to incorporate them into the proposed deep recommender system (DEERS) framework.

Recently deep learning based models have been proposed, which follow a similar Embedding&MLP paradigm. In these methods large scale sparse input features are first mapped into low dimensional embedding vectors, and then transformed into fixed-length vectors in a group-wise manner, finally concatenated together to fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to learn the nonlinear relations among features. In this way, user features are compressed into a fixed-length representation vector, in regardless of what candidate ads are. The use of fixed-length vector will be a bottleneck, which brings difficulty for Embedding&MLP methods to capture user's diverse interests effectively from rich historical behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel model: Deep Interest Network (DIN) which tackles this challenge by designing a local activation unit to adaptively learn the representation of user interests from historical behaviors with respect to a certain ad. This representation vector varies over different ads, improving the expressive ability of model greatly. Besides, we develop two techniques: mini-batch aware regularization and data adaptive activation function which can help training industrial deep networks with hundreds of millions of parameters. Experiments on two public datasets as well as an Alibaba real production dataset with over 2 billion samples demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approaches, which achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

To this end, the optimal allocation of cultural establishments and related resources across urban regions becomes of vital importance, as it can reduce financial costs in terms of planning and improve quality of life in the city, more generally. In this paper, we make use of a large longitudinal dataset of user location check-ins from the online social network WeChat to develop a data-driven framework for cultural planning in the city of Beijing. We exploit rich spatio-temporal representations on user activity at cultural venues and use a novel extended version of the traditional latent Dirichlet allocation model that incorporates temporal information to identify latent patterns of urban cultural interactions. Using the characteristic typologies of mobile user cultural activities emitted by the model, we determine the levels of demand for different types of cultural resources across urban areas. We then compare those with the corresponding levels of supply as driven by the presence and spatial reach of cultural venues in local areas to obtain high resolution maps that indicate urban regions with lack of cultural resources, and thus give suggestions for further urban cultural planning and investment optimisation."

In systems with large corpus, however, the calculation cost for the learnt model to predict all user-item preferences is tremendous, which makes full corpus retrieval extremely difficult. To overcome the calculation barriers, models such as matrix factorization resort to inner product form (i.e., model user-item preference as the inner product of user, item latent factors) and indexes to facilitate efficient approximate k-nearest neighbor searches. However, it still remains challenging to incorporate more expressive interaction forms between user and item features, e.g., interactions through deep neural networks, because of the calculation cost. In this paper, we focus on the problem of introducing arbitrary advanced models to recommender systems with large corpus. We propose a novel tree-based method which can provide logarithmic complexity w.r.t. corpus size even with more expressive models such as deep neural networks. Our main idea is to predict user interests from coarse to fine by traversing tree nodes in a top-down fashion and making decisions for each user-node pair. We also show that the tree structure can be jointly learnt towards better compatibility with users' interest distribution and hence facilitate both training and prediction. Experimental evaluations with two large-scale real-world datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional methods.

Tsourakakis, ","A long line of work in social psychology has studied variations in people's susceptibility to persuasion -- the extent to which they are willing to modify their opinions on a topic. This body of literature suggests an interesting perspective on theoretical models of opinion formation on social networks: in addition to considering interventions that directly modify people's intrinsic opinions, it is also natural to consider those that modify people's susceptibility to persuasion. Here, we adopt a popular model for social opinion dynamics, and formalize the opinion maximization and minimization problems where interventions happen at the level of susceptibility. We show that modeling interventions at the level of susceptibility leads to an interesting family of new questions in network opinion dynamics. We find that the questions are quite different depending on whether there is an overall budget constraining the number of agents we can target or not. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the optimal target-set to optimize the sum of opinions when there are no budget constraints on the size of the target-set. We show that this problem is NP-hard when there is a budget, and that the objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular. Finally, we propose a heuristic for the budgeted opinion optimization problem and show its efficacy at finding target-sets that optimize the sum of opinions on real world networks, including a Twitter network with real opinion estimates."

Since for many online or streaming textual sources such as news outlets, the number, and nature of topics change over time, there have been several efforts that attempt to address such situations using dynamic versions of topic models. Unfortunately, existing approaches encounter more complex inferencing when their model parameters are varied over time, resulting in high computation complexity and performance degradation. This paper introduces the DM-DTM, a dual Markov chain dynamic topic model, for characterizing a corpus that evolves over time. This model uses a gamma Markov chain and a Dirichlet Markov chain to allow the topic popularities and word-topic assignments, respectively, to vary smoothly over time. Novel applications of the Negative-Binomial augmentation trick result in simple, efficient, closed-form updates of all the required conditional posteriors, resulting in far lower computational requirements as well as less sensitivity to initial conditions, as compared to existing approaches. Moreover, via a gamma process prior, the number of desired topics is inferred directly from the data rather than being pre-specified and can vary as the data changes. Empirical comparisons using multiple real-world corpora demonstrate a clear superiority of DM-DTM over strong baselines for both static and dynamic topic models."

This means that, at least for the time being, freelancing and salaried employment will continue to co-exist. In this paper, we provide algorithms for outsourcing and hiring workers in a general setting, where workers form a team and contribute different skills to perform a task. We call this model team formation with outsourcing. In our model, tasks arrive in an online fashion: neither the number nor the composition of the tasks are known a-priori.

This team is dynamic: new members can be hired and existing members can be fired, at some cost. Additionally, some parts of the arriving tasks can be outsourced and thus completed by non-team members, at a premium. Our contribution is an efficient online cost-minimizing algorithm for hiring and firing team members and outsourcing tasks.

In both cases the block model's interaction or mixing matrix can be useful for understanding potential interaction (for structural graphs) and actual interaction (for behavioral graphs) between the blocks. In this paper we explore finding block models where there is both a structural network and multiple behavioral graphs. This provides significant modeling challenges, consider if there is strong behavioral connectivity but no structural connectivity between two nodes.

Specifically, the model takes the existing modality as input and generates the missing modality. By employing an auxiliary adversarial loss, our model is able to generate high-quality missing modality images.

We evaluate our method on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative~(ADNI) database, where positron emission tomography~(PET) modalities are missing. Experimental results show that the trained network can generate high-quality PET modalities based on existing magnetic resonance imaging~(MRI) modalities, and provide complementary information to improve the detection and tracking of the Alzheimer's disease.

However, most of existing heterogenous information network embedding models adopt the dot product to measure the proximity in the low dimensional space, and thus they can only preserve the first-order proximity and are insufficient to capture the global structure. Compared with homogenous information networks, there are multiple types of links (i.e., multiple relations) in HINs, and the link distribution w.r.t relations is highly skewed. To address the above challenging issues, we propose a novel heterogenous information network embedding model PME based on the metric learning to capture both first-order and second-order proximities in a unified way. To alleviate the potential geometrical inflexibility of existing metric learning approaches, we propose to build object and relation embeddings in separate object space and relation spaces rather than in a common space. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by firstly projecting vertices from object space to corresponding relation space and then calculate the proximity between projected vertices. To overcome the heavy skewness of the link distribution w.r.t relations and avoid ""over-sampling'' or ""under-sampling'' for each relation, we propose a novel loss-aware adaptive sampling approach for the model optimization.

DNC has a quadratic time complexity, which is a significant reduction comparing with the cubic time complexity of the traditional spectral clustering. To cope with large-scale data, a Fast Normalized Cut (FNC) method with linear time and space complexities is proposed by extending DNC with an anchor-based strategy.

In this paper, we study 20 Questions, an online interactive game where each question-response pair corresponds to a fact of the target entity, to acquire highly accurate knowledge effectively with nearly zero labor cost. Knowledge acquisition via 20 Questions predominantly presents two challenges to the intelligent agent playing games with human players. The first one is to seek enough information and identify the target entity with as few questions as possible, while the second one is to leverage the remaining questioning opportunities to acquire valuable knowledge effectively, both of which count on good questioning strategies. To address these challenges, we propose the Learning-to-Ask (LA) framework, within which the agent learns smart questioning strategies for information seeking and knowledge acquisition by means of deep reinforcement learning and generalized matrix factorization respectively. In addition, a Bayesian approach to represent knowledge is adopted to ensure robustness to noisy user responses. Simulating experiments on real data show that LA is able to equip the agent with effective questioning strategies, which result in high winning rates and rapid knowledge acquisition. Moreover, the questioning strategies for information seeking and knowledge acquisition boost the performance of each other, allowing the agent to start with a relatively small knowledge set and quickly improve its knowledge base in the absence of constant human supervision."

One of the most popular methods employs an encoder-decoder network in which deconvolutional layers are used for up-sampling feature maps. However, a key limitation of the deconvolutional layer is that it suffers from the checkerboard artifact problem, which harms the prediction accuracy. This is caused by the independency among adjacent pixels on the output feature maps. Previous work only solved the checkerboard artifact issue of deconvolutional layers in the 2D space. Since the number of intermediate feature maps needed to generate a deconvolutional layer grows exponentially with dimensionality, it is more challenging to solve this issue in higher dimensions. In this work, we propose the voxel deconvolutional layer (VoxelDCL) to solve the checkerboard artifact problem of deconvolutional layers in 3D space. We also provide an efficient approach to implement VoxelDCL. To demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelDCL, we build four variations of voxel deconvolutional networks (VoxelDCN) based on the U-Net architecture with VoxelDCL. We apply our networks to address volumetric brain images labeling tasks using the ADNI and LONI LPBA40 datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed iVoxelDCNa achieves improved performance in all experiments. It reaches 83.34% in terms of dice ratio on the ADNI dataset and 79.12% on the LONI LPBA40 dataset, which increases 1.39% and 2.21% respectively compared with the baseline. In addition, all the variations of VoxelDCN we proposed outperform the baseline methods on the above datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods."

Existing works interpret a pre-trained neural network by analyzing hidden neurons, mimicking pre-trained models or approximating local predictions. However, these methods do not provide a guarantee on the exactness and consistency of their interpretations. In this paper, we propose an elegant closed form solution named $OpenBox$ to compute exact and consistent interpretations for the family of Piecewise Linear Neural Networks (PLNN). The major idea is to first transform a PLNN into a mathematically equivalent set of linear classifiers, then interpret each linear classifier by the features that dominate its prediction. We further apply $OpenBox$ to demonstrate the effectiveness of non-negative and sparse constraints on improving the interpretability of PLNNs. The extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world data sets clearly demonstrate the exactness and consistency of our interpretation."

Often, these agents operate in diverse, non-stationary environments, where models rely on hand-crafted environment-specific features to infer influential regions in the system's surroundings. To overcome the limitations of these inflexible models, we present GP-LAPLACE, a technique for locating sources and sinks from trajectories in time-varying fields. Using Gaussian processes, we jointly infer a spatio-temporal vector field, as well as canonical vector calculus operations on that field. Notably, we do this from only agent trajectories without requiring knowledge of the environment, and also obtain a metric for denoting the significance of inferred causal features in the environment by exploiting our probabilistic method. To evaluate our approach, we apply it to both synthetic and real-world GPS data, demonstrating the applicability of our technique in the presence of multiple agents, as well as its superiority over existing methods."

This set of eigenvalues encapsulates many aspects of the structure of the graph, including the extent to which the graph posses community structures at multiple scales. We study the problem of approximating the spectrum, $łambda = (łambda_1,\dots,łambda_|V| )$, of G in the regime where the graph is too large to explicitly calculate the spectrum. We present a sublinear time algorithm that, given the ability to query a random node in the graph and select a random neighbor of a given node, computes a succinct representation of an approximation $\widetilde łambda = (\widetilde łambda_1,\dots,\widetilde łambda_|V| )$, such that $\|\widetilde łambda - łambda\|_1 łe ε |V|$. Our algorithm has query complexity and running time $exp(O(1/\eps))$, which is independent of the size of the graph, $|V|$. We demonstrate the practical viability of our algorithm on synthetically generated graphs, and on 15 different real-world graphs from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection, including social networks, academic collaboration graphs, and road networks. For the smallest of these graphs, we are able to validate the accuracy of our algorithm by explicitly calculating the true spectrum; for the larger graphs, such a calculation is computationally prohibitive. The spectra of these real-world networks reveal insights into the structural similarities and differences between them, illustrating the potential value of our algorithm for efficiently approximating the spectrum of large large networks."

We present D2K, which is the first algorithm able to find large k-plexes of very large graphs in just a few minutes. The good performance of our algorithm follows from a combination of graph-theoretical concepts, careful algorithm engineering and a high-performance implementation. In particular, we exploit the low degeneracy of real-world graphs, and the fact that large enough k-plexes have diameter 2.

When applied to networks, the challenge is two-fold: the number of q-grams generated from labeled paths grows exponentially with q, and their frequency should be taken into account: this leads to a variation of the Jaccard index known as Bray-Curtis index for multisets. We describe nSimGram, a suite of fast algorithms for node similarity with q-grams, based on a novel blend of color coding, probabilistic counting, sketches, and string algorithms, where the universe of elements to sample is exponential.

However, in many real world applications, existing methods may not be robust when the correspondence across domains is noisy or labeled instances are not representative. In this paper, we develop a novel transfer learning framework called Transfer Learning via Feature Isomorphism Discovery (abbreviated to TLFid), which owns high tolerance for noisy correspondence between domains as well as scarce or non-existing labeled instances. More specifically, we propose a feature isomorphism approach to discovering common substructures across feature spaces and learning a feature mapping function from the target domain to the source domain.

Algorithmic investment provides another rational way to formulate human knowledge as a trading agent. However, it still requires well-built knowledge and experience to design effective trading algorithms in such a volatile market. Fortunately, various kinds of historical trading records are easy to obtain in this big-data era, it is invaluable of us to extract the trading knowledge hidden in the data to help people make better decisions. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning driven Investor-Imitator framework to formalize the trading knowledge, by imitating an investor's behavior with a set of logic descriptors. In particular, to instantiate specific logic descriptors, we introduce the Rank-Invest model that can keep the diversity of logic descriptors by learning to optimize different evaluation metrics. In the experiment, we first simulate three types of investors, representing different degrees of information disclosure we may meet in real market. By learning towards these investors, we can tell the inherent trading logic of the target investor with the Investor-Imitator empirically, and the extracted interpretable knowledge can help us better understand and construct trading portfolios. Experimental results in this paper sufficiently demonstrate the designed purpose of Investor-Imitator, it makes the Investor-Imitator an applicable and meaningful intelligent trading framework in financial investment research."

The identification of such roles provides key insight into the organization of networks and can be used for a variety of machine learning tasks. However, learning structural representations of nodes is a challenging problem, and it has typically involved manually specifying and tailoring topological features for each node. In this paper, we develop GraphWave, a method that represents each node's network neighborhood via a low-dimensional embedding by leveraging heat wavelet diffusion patterns. Instead of training on hand-selected features, GraphWave learns these embeddings in an unsupervised way. We mathematically prove that nodes with similar network neighborhoods will have similar GraphWave embeddings even though these nodes may reside in very different parts of the network, and our method scales linearly with the number of edges. Experiments in a variety of different settings demonstrate GraphWave's real-world potential for capturing structural roles in networks, and our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines in every experiment, by as much as 137%."

Despite tremendous effort, state-of-the-art methods still require a complexity that is at least \em quadratic in the number of nodes of graphs, even with approximations. In this paper, we propose a family of Krylov subspace based algorithms (\fasten) to speed up and scale up the computation of Sylvester equation for graph mining. The key idea of the proposed methods is to project the original equivalent linear system onto a Kronecker Krylov subspace. We further exploit (1) the implicit representation of the solution matrix as well as the associated computation, and (2) the decomposition of the original Sylvester equation into a set of inter-correlated Sylvester equations of smaller size. The proposed algorithms bear two distinctive features. First, they provide the \em exact solutions without any approximation error. Second, they significantly reduce the time and space complexity for solving Sylvester equation, with two of the proposed algorithms having a \em linear complexity in both time and space.

Based on the generative adversarial networks (GANs), particularly conditional ones, cross-domain joint distribution matching is an increasingly popular kind of methods addressing such problems. Though significant advances have been achieved, there are still two main disadvantages of existing models, i.e., the requirement of large amount of paired training samples and the notorious instability of training. In this paper, we propose a multi-view adversarially learned inference (ALI) model, termed as MALI, to address these issues. Unlike the common practice of learning direct domain mappings, our model relies on shared latent representations of both domains and can generate arbitrary number of paired faking samples, benefiting from which usually very few paired samples (together with sufficient unpaired ones) is enough for learning good mappings. Extending the vanilla ALI model, we design novel discriminators to judge the quality of generated samples (both paired and unpaired), and provide theoretical analysis of our new formulation. Experiments on image-to-image translation, image-to-attribute generation (multi-label classification), attribute-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that our semi-supervised learning framework yields significant performance improvements over existing ones. Results on cross-modality retrieval show that our latent space based method can achieve competitive similarity search performance in relative fast speed, compared to those methods that compute similarities in the high-dimensional data space."

Existing attempts based on local interpretations aim to identify relevant features contributing the most to the prediction of DNN by monitoring the neighborhood of a given input. They usually simply ignore the intermediate layers of the DNN that might contain rich information for interpretation. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose to investigate a guided feature inversion framework for taking advantage of the deep architectures towards effective interpretation. The proposed framework not only determines the contribution of each feature in the input but also provides insights into the decision-making process of DNN models. By further interacting with the neuron of the target category at the output layer of the DNN, we enforce the interpretation result to be class-discriminative.

This is especially true in clinical applications, where the future state of the patient can be less important than the patient's overall trajectory. This requires multi-step forecasting, a forecasting variant where one aims to predict multiple values in the future simultaneously. Standard methods to accomplish this can propagate error from prediction to prediction, reducing quality over the long term. In light of these challenges, we propose multi-output deep architectures for multi-step forecasting in which we explicitly model the distribution of future values of the signal over a prediction horizon. We apply these techniques to the challenging and clinically relevant task of blood glucose forecasting. Through a series of experiments on a real-world dataset consisting of 550K blood glucose measurements, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches in capturing the underlying signal dynamics. Compared to existing shallow and deep methods, we find that our proposed approaches improve performance individually and capture complementary information, leading to a large improvement over the baseline when combined (4.87 vs. 5.31 absolute percentage error (APE)). Overall, the results suggest the efficacy of our proposed approach in predicting blood glucose level and multi-step forecasting more generally."

To overcome the above issues, this paper proposes a novel query selection criterion called approximated error reduction (AER). In AER, the error reduction of each candidate is estimated based on an expected impact over all datapoints and an approximated ratio between the error reduction and the impact over its nearby datapoints. In particular, we utilize hierarchical anchor graphs to construct the candidate set as well as the nearby datapoint sets of these candidates. The benefit of this strategy is that it enables a hierarchical expansion of candidates with the increase of labels, and allows us to further accelerate the AER estimation.

Network embedding is to learn low-dimensional representations for nodes in a network. A popular kind of existing methods, such as DeepWalk, Node2Vec, and LINE, learn node representations by pushing positive context node to the anchor node while pushing negative context nodes away from it in the low-dimensional vector space. When sampling the negative context nodes, they usually employ a predefined sampling distribution based on the node popularity. However, this sampling distribution often fails to capture the real informativeness of each node and cannot reflect the training state. To address these important problems, in this paper, we propose a novel self-paced network embedding method. Specifically, our method can adaptively capture the informativeness of each node based on the current training state, and sample negative context nodes in terms of their informativeness. The proposed self-paced sampling strategy can gradually select difficult negative context nodes with training process going on to learn better node representations. Moreover, to better capture the node informativeness for learning node representations, we extend our method to the generative adversarial network framework, which has the larger capacity to discover node informativeness.

In CNNs, the trainable local filters enable the automatic extraction of high-level features. The computation with filters requires a fixed number of ordered units in the receptive fields. However, the number of neighboring units is neither fixed nor are they ordered in generic graphs, thereby hindering the applications of convolutional operations. Here, we address these challenges by proposing the learnable graph convolutional layer (LGCL). LGCL automatically selects a fixed number of neighboring nodes for each feature based on value ranking in order to transform graph data into grid-like structures in 1-D format, thereby enabling the use of regular convolutional operations on generic graphs. To enable model training on large-scale graphs, we propose a sub-graph training method to reduce the excessive memory and computational resource requirements suffered by prior methods on graph convolutions. Our experimental results on node classification tasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that our methods can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network datasets.

Although the rapid development of gene expression profiling has been observed, genome-wide profiling of large libraries is still expensive and difficult. Due to the fact that there are significant correlations between gene expression patterns, previous studies introduced regression models for predicting the target gene expressions from the landmark gene profiles. These models formulate the gene expression inference in a completely supervised manner, which require a large labeled dataset (i.e. paired landmark and target gene expressions). However, collecting the whole gene expressions is much more expensive than the landmark genes. In order to address this issue and take advantage of cheap unlabeled data (i.e. landmark genes), we propose a novel semi-supervised deep generative model for target gene expression inference. Our model is based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) to approximate the joint distribution of landmark and target genes, and an inference network to learn the conditional distribution of target genes given the landmark genes. We employ the reliable generated data by our GAN model as the extra training pairs to improve the training of our inference model, and utilize the trustworthy predictions of the inference network to enhance the adversarial training of our GAN network.

Moreover, in the most general setting a node may be a member of multiple communities, and thus, interact with more than one cohesive group of other nodes. If node interactions are observed over a long period and aggregated into a single static network, the communities may be hard to discern due to their in-network overlap. Alternatively, if interactions are observed over short time periods, the communities may be only partially observable. How can we detect communities at an appropriate temporal resolution that resonates with their natural periods of activity? We propose LARC, a general framework for joint learning of the overlapping community structure and the periods of activity of communities, directly from temporal interaction data. We formulate the problem as an optimization task coupling community fit and smooth temporal activation over time. To the best of our knowledge, the tensor version of LARC is the first tensor-based community detection method to introduce such smoothness constraints. We propose efficient algorithms for the problem, achieving a $2.6x$ quality improvement over all baselines for high temporal resolution datasets, and consistently detecting better-quality communities for different levels of data aggregation and varying community overlap. In addition, LARC elucidates interpretable temporal patterns of community activity corresponding to botnet attacks, transportation change points and public forum interaction trends, while being computationally practical---few minutes on large real datasets. Finally, LARC provides a comprehensive \em unsupervised parameter estimation methodology yielding high accuracy and rendering it easy-to-use for practitioners."

Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machine (S3VM) is a powerful semi-supervised learning model. However, the high computational cost and non-convexity severely impede the S3VM method in large-scale applications. Although several learning algorithms were proposed for S3VM, scaling up S3VM is still an open problem. To address this challenging problem, in this paper, we propose a new incremental learning algorithm to scale up S3VM (IL-S3VM) based on the path following technique in the framework of Difference of Convex (DC) programming. The traditional DC programming based algorithms need multiple outer loops and are not suitable for incremental learning, and traditional path following algorithms are limited to convex problems. Our new IL-S3VM algorithm based on the path-following technique can directly update the solution of S3VM to converge to a local minimum within one outer loop so that the efficient incremental learning can be achieved. More importantly, we provide the finite convergence analysis for our new algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, our new IL-S3VM algorithm is the first efficient path following algorithm for a non-convex problem (i.e., S3VM) with local minimum convergence guarantee. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark datasets not only confirm the finite convergence of IL-S3VM, but also show a huge reduction of computational time compared with existing batch and incremental learning algorithms, while retaining the similar generalization performance."

In this paper, we propose a learning-based hashing algorithm called ""Robust Rotated Supervised Discrete Hashing"" (R 2 SDH), by extending the previous work on ""Supervised Discrete Hashing"" (SDH). In R 2 SDH, correntropy is adopted to replace the least square regression (LSR) model in SDH for achieving better robustness. Furthermore, considering the commonly used distance metrics such as cosine and Euclidean distance are invariant to rotational transformation, rotation is integrated into the original zero-one label matrix used in SDH, as additional freedom to promote flexibility without sacrificing accuracy. The rotation matrix is learned through an optimization procedure. Experimental results on three image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and NUS-WIDE) confirm that R 2 SDH generally outperforms SDH."

Most of the current techniques assume that the input features of data instances are complete. Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of highly incomplete features and weak label assignments is a challenging and widely perceived issue in real-world multi-label learning applications due to a number of practical reasons including incomplete data collection, moderate labels from annotators, etc. Existing multi-label learning algorithms are not directly applicable when the observed features are highly incomplete. In this work, we attack this problem by proposing a weakly supervised multi-label learning approach, based on the idea of collaborative embedding. This approach provides a flexible framework to conduct efficient multi-label classification at both transductive and inductive mode by coupling the process of reconstructing missing features and weak label assignments in a joint optimisation framework. It is designed to collaboratively recover feature and label information, and extract the predictive association between the feature profile and the multi-label tag of the same data instance. Substantial experiments on public benchmark datasets and real security event data validate that our proposed method can provide distinctively more accurate transductive and inductive classification than other state-of-the-art algorithms."

Classically, principal components of a dataset are interpreted as the directions that preserve most of its ""energy"", an interpretation that is theoretically underpinned by the celebrated Eckart-Young-Mirsky Theorem. There are yet other ways of interpreting PCA that are rarely exploited in practice, largely because it is not known how to reliably solve the corresponding non-convex optimisation programs. In this paper, we consider one such interpretation of principal components as the directions that preserve most of the ""volume"" of the dataset. Our main contribution is a theorem that shows that the corresponding non-convex program has no spurious local optima, and is therefore amenable to many convex solvers. We also confirm our findings numerically."

To handle this kind of data, Grassmann kernels were proposed to measure the space structure and used with classifiers, e.g., Support Vector Machines (SVMs). However, the existing discriminative algorithms mostly ignore the instability of subspaces, which would cause the classifiers to be misled by disturbed instances. Thus we propose considering all potential disturbances of subspaces in learning processes to obtain more robust classifiers. Firstly, we derive the dual optimization of linear classifiers with disturbances subject to a known distribution, resulting in a new kernel, Disturbance Grassmann (DG) kernel. Secondly, we research into two kinds of disturbance, relevant to the subspace matrix and singular values of bases, with which we extend the Projection kernel on Grassmann manifolds to two new kernels. Experiments on action data indicate that the proposed kernels perform better compared to state-of-the-art subspace-based methods, even in a worse environment."

Yu, ","Heterogeneous information network (HIN) has been widely adopted in recommender systems due to its excellence in modeling complex context information. Although existing HIN based recommendation methods have achieved performance improvement to some extent, they have two major shortcomings. First, these models seldom learn an explicit representation for path or meta-path in the recommendation task. Second, they do not consider the mutual effect between the meta-path and the involved user-item pair in an interaction. To address these issues, we develop a novel deep neural network with the co-attention mechanism for leveraging rich meta-path based context for top-N recommendation. We elaborately design a three-way neural interaction model by explicitly incorporating meta-path based context. To construct the meta-path based context, we propose to use a priority based sampling technique to select high-quality path instances. Our model is able to learn effective representations for users, items and meta-path based context for implementing a powerful interaction function. The co-attention mechanism improves the representations for meta-path based con- text, users and items in a mutual enhancement way. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model. In particular, the proposed model performs well in the cold-start scenario and has potentially good interpretability for the recommendation results."

In the traditional settings of metric learning, an implicit assumption is that the associated labels of the instances are deterministic. However, in many real-world applications, the associated labels come naturally with probabilities instead of deterministic values. Thus, the existing metric learning methods cannot work well in these applications. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we study how to effectively learn the distance metric from datasets that contain probabilistic information, and then propose two novel metric learning mechanisms for two types of probabilistic labels, i.e., the instance-wise probabilistic label and the group-wise probabilistic label. Compared with the existing metric learning methods, our proposed mechanisms are capable of learning distance metrics directly from the probabilistic labels with high accuracy. We also theoretically analyze the two proposed mechanisms and provide theoretical bounds on the sample complexity for both of them. Additionally, extensive experiments based on real-world datasets are conducted to verify the desirable properties of the proposed mechanisms."

Roughly speaking, there are two types of methods for causal discovery, constraint-based ones and score-based ones. Score-based methods avoid the multiple testing problem and enjoy certain advantages compared to constraint-based ones. However, most of them need strong assumptions on the functional forms of causal mechanisms, as well as on data distributions, which limit their applicability. In practice the precise information of the underlying model class is usually unknown. If the above assumptions are violated, both spurious and missing edges may result. In this paper, we introduce generalized score functions for causal discovery based on the characterization of general (conditional) independence relationships between random variables, without assuming particular model classes. In particular, we exploit regression in RKHS to capture the dependence in a nonparametric way. The resulting causal discovery approach produces asymptotically correct results in rather general cases, which may have nonlinear causal mechanisms, a wide class of data distributions, mixed continuous and discrete data, and multidimensional variables. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach."

H. Tung, ","The problem of Approximate Maximum Inner Product (AMIP) search has received increasing attention due to its wide applications. Interestingly, based on asymmetric transformation, the problem can be reduced to the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, and hence leverage Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to find solution. However, existing asymmetric transformations such as L2-ALSH and XBOX, suffer from large distortion error in reducing AMIP search to ANN search, such that the results of AMIP search can be arbitrarily bad. In this paper, we propose a novel Asymmetric LSH scheme based on Homocentric Hypersphere partition (H2-ALSH) for high-dimensional AMIP search. On the one hand, we propose a novel Query Normalized First (QNF) transformation to significantly reduce the distortion error. On the other hand, by adopting the homocentric hypersphere partition strategy, we can not only improve the search efficiency with early stop pruning, but also get higher search accuracy by further reducing the distortion error with limited data range. Our theoretical studies show that H2-ALSH enjoys a guarantee on search accuracy. Experimental results over four real datasets demonstrate that H2-ALSH significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes."

While feature acquisition usually involves special devices or complex process, it is expensive to acquire all feature values for the whole dataset. On the other hand, features may be correlated with each other, and some values may be recovered from the others. It is thus important to decide which features are most informative for recovering the other features as well as improving the learning performance. In this paper, we try to train an effective classification model with least acquisition cost by jointly performing active feature querying and supervised matrix completion. When completing the feature matrix, a novel objective function is proposed to simultaneously minimize the reconstruction error on observed entries and the supervised loss on training data. When querying the feature value, the most uncertain entry is actively selected based on the variance of previous iterations. In addition, a bi-objective optimization method is presented for cost-aware active selection when features bear different acquisition costs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is well validated by both theoretical analysis and experimental study."

However, training an effective DNN model for a specific task is rather challenging because it requires a prior knowledge or experience to design the network architecture, repeated trial-and-error process to tune the parameters, and a large set of labeled data to train the model. In this paper, we propose to overcome these challenges by actively adapting a pre-trained model to a new task with less labeled examples. Specifically, the pre-trained model is iteratively fine tuned based on the most useful examples. The examples are actively selected based on a novel criterion, which jointly estimates the potential contribution of an instance on optimizing the feature representation as well as improving the classification model for the target task. On one hand, the pre-trained model brings plentiful information from its original task, avoiding redesign of the network architecture or training from scratch; and on the other hand, the labeling cost can be significantly reduced by active label querying. Experiments on multiple datasets and different pre-trained models demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve cost-effective training of DNNs."

This problem of mining implicit linkage is known as hypotheses generation and its potential to accelerate scientific progress is widely recognized. Almost all of the prior studies to tackle this problem ignore the temporal dynamics of concepts. This is limiting because it is known that the semantic meaning of a concept evolves over time. To overcome this issue, in this study, we define this problem as mining time-aware Top-k conceptual bridges, and in doing so provide a systematic approach to formalize the problem. Specifically, the proposed model first extracts relevant entities from the corpus, represents them in time-specific latent spaces, and then further reasons upon it to generate novel and experimentally testable hypotheses. The key challenge in this approach is to learn a mapping function that encodes the temporal characteristics of concepts and aligns the across-time latent spaces. To solve this, we propose an effective algorithm that learns precise mapping sensitive to both global and local semantics of the input query. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations performed on the largest available biomedical corpus substantiate the importance of leveraging the evolutionary semantics of medical concepts and suggests that the generated hypotheses are novel and worthy of clinical trials."

This paper is aimed at developing a treatment engine, which learns from historical EMR data and provides a patient with next-period prescriptions based on disease conditions, laboratory results, and treatment records of the patient. Importantly, the engine takes consideration of both treatment records and physical examination sequences which are not only heterogeneous and temporal in nature but also often with different record frequencies and lengths. Moreover, the engine also combines static information (e.g., demographics) with the temporal sequences to provide personalized treatment prescriptions to patients. In this regard, a novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) learning framework is proposed to model inter-correlations of different types of medical sequences by connections between hidden neurons. With this framework, we develop three multifaceted LSTM models: Fully Connected Heterogeneous LSTM, Partially Connected Heterogeneous LSTM, and Decomposed Heterogeneous LSTM. The experiments are conducted on two datasets: one is the public MIMIC-III ICU data, and the other comes from several Chinese hospitals. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the framework and the three models.

Traditional methods correct the distribution shift by reweighting training data with the ratio of the density between test and training data. However, in many applications training takes place without prior knowledge of the testing distribution. Recently, methods have been proposed to address the shift by learning the underlying causal structure, but those methods rely on diversity arising from multiple training data sets, and they further have complexity limitations in high dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Global Balancing Regression (DGBR) algorithm to jointly optimize a deep auto-encoder model for feature selection and a global balancing model for stable prediction across unknown environments. The global balancing model constructs balancing weights that facilitate estimation of partial effects of features (holding fixed all other features), a problem that is challenging in high dimensions, and thus helps to identify stable, causal relationships between features and outcomes. The deep auto-encoder model is designed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, thus making global balancing easier. We show, both theoretically and with empirical experiments, that our algorithm can make stable predictions across unknown environments. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for stable prediction across unknown environments."

In various applications, such as spam-mail classification, the decision boundary dynamically changes over time. Accordingly, the performance of classifiers deteriorates quickly unless the classifiers are retrained using additional labeled data. However, continuously preparing such data is quite expensive or impossible. The proposed method alleviates this deterioration in performance by using newly obtained unlabeled data, which are easy to prepare, as well as labeled data collected beforehand. With the proposed method, the dynamics of the decision boundary is modeled by Gaussian processes. To exploit information on the decision boundaries from unlabeled data, the low-density separation criterion, i.e., the decision boundary should not cross high-density regions, but instead lie in low-density regions, is assumed with the proposed method. We incorporate this criterion into our framework in a principled manner by introducing the entropy posterior regularization to the posterior of the classifier parameters on the basis of the generic regularized Bayesian framework. We developed an efficient inference algorithm for the model based on variational Bayesian inference.

For sequential data, the relations not only span across views, but also extend throughout the view length to form long-term intra-view and inter-view interactions. In this paper, we present a new memory augmented neural network that aims to model these complex interactions between two asynchronous sequential views. Our model uses two encoders for reading from and writing to two external memories for encoding input views. The intra-view interactions and the long-term dependencies are captured by the use of memories during this encoding process. There are two modes of memory accessing in our system: late-fusion and early-fusion, corresponding to late and early inter-view interactions. In the late-fusion mode, the two memories are separated, containing only view-specific contents. In the early-fusion mode, the two memories share the same addressing space, allowing cross-memory accessing. In both cases, the knowledge from the memories will be combined by a decoder to make predictions over the output space. The resulting dual memory neural computer is demonstrated on a comprehensive set of experiments, including a synthetic task of summing two sequences and the tasks of drug prescription and disease progression in healthcare.

In many real-world applications, however, graphs can be noisy with discriminative patterns confined to certain regions in the graph only. In this work, we study the problem of attention-based graph classification. The use of attention allows us to focus on small but informative parts of the graph, avoiding noise in the rest of the graph.

Hanratty, ","Pattern-based methods have been successful in information extraction and NLP research. Previous approaches learn the quality of a textual pattern as relatedness to a certain task based on statistics of its individual content (e.g., length, frequency) and hundreds of carefully-annotated labels. However, patterns of good content-quality may generate heavily conflicting information due to the big gap between relatedness and correctness. Evaluating the correctness of information is critical in (entity, attribute, value)-tuple extraction. In this work, we propose a novel method, called TruePIE, that finds reliable patterns which can extract not only related but also correct information. TruePIE adopts the self-training framework and repeats the training-predicting-extracting process to gradually discover more and more reliable patterns. To better represent the textual patterns, pattern embeddings are formulated so that patterns with similar semantic meanings are embedded closely to each other. The embeddings jointly consider the local pattern information and the distributional information of the extractions. To conquer the challenge of lacking supervision on patterns' reliability, TruePIE can automatically generate high quality training patterns based on a couple of seed patterns by applying the arity-constraints to distinguish highly reliable patterns (i.e., positive patterns) and highly unreliable patterns (i.e., negative patterns). Experiments on a huge news dataset (over 25GB) demonstrate that the proposed TruePIE significantly outperforms baseline methods on each of the three tasks: reliable tuple extraction, reliable pattern extraction, and negative pattern extraction."

The existing algorithms are not guaranteed to be statistically efficient in our problem because the number of recommended lists can grow exponentially with their length. To overcome this challenge, we use models of user interaction with the list of items, the so-called click models, to construct estimators that learn statistically efficiently.

Most existing approaches for travel time estimation assume that the route of the trip is given, which does not hold in real-world applications since the route can be dynamically changed due to traffic conditions, user preferences, etc. As inferring the path from the origin and the destination can be time-consuming and nevertheless error-prone, it is desirable to perform origin-destination travel time estimation, which aims to predict the travel time without online route information. This problem is challenging mainly due to its limited amount of information available and the complicated spatiotemporal dependency. In this paper, we propose a MUlti-task Representation learning model for Arrival Time estimation (MURAT). This model produces meaningful representation that preserves various trip properties in the real-world and at the same time leverages the underlying road network and the spatiotemporal prior knowledge.

Due to the variety in the quality of users, it is important to infer their ability to provide correct answers during aggregation. Therefore, truth discovery methods can be used to automatically capture the user quality and aggregate user-contributed answers via a weighted combination. Despite the fact that truth discovery is an effective tool for answer aggregation, existing work falls short of the protection towards the privacy of participating users. To fill this gap, we propose perturbation-based mechanisms that provide users with privacy guarantees and maintain the accuracy of aggregated answers. We first present a one-layer mechanism, in which all the users adopt the same probability to perturb their answers. Aggregation is then conducted on perturbed answers but the aggregation accuracy could drop accordingly. To improve the utility, a two-layer mechanism is proposed where users are allowed to sample their own probabilities from a hyper distribution. We theoretically compare the one-layer and two-layer mechanisms, and prove that they provide the same privacy guarantee while the two-layer mechanism delivers better utility. This advantage is brought by the fact that the two-layer mechanism can utilize the estimated user quality information from truth discovery to reduce the accuracy loss caused by perturbation, which is confirmed by experimental results on real-world datasets. Experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-layer mechanism in privacy protection with tolerable accuracy loss in aggregation."

However, this scheme does not naturally work on discrete data, e.g., text; in addition, learning a good data representation is sometimes directly opposed to the goal of learning a high performance prediction model. To address the issues of this type of methods, we reformulate the semi-supervised learning as a model-based reinforcement learning problem and propose an adversarial networks based framework. The proposed framework contains two networks: a predictor network for target estimation and a judge network for evaluation. The judge network iteratively generates proper reward to guide the training of predictor network, and the predictor network is trained via policy gradient. Based on the aforementioned framework, we propose a recurrent neural network based model for semi-supervised text classification. We conduct comprehensive experimental analysis on several real world benchmark text datasets, and the results from our evaluations show that our method outperforms other competing state-of-the-art methods."

Currently, operators try to constantly reposition bikes among stations when the system is operating. However, how to efficiently reposition to minimize the customer loss in a long period remains unsolved. We propose a spatio-temporal reinforcement learning based bike reposition model to deal with this problem. Firstly, an inter-independent inner-balance clustering algorithm is proposed to cluster stations into groups. Clusters obtained have two properties, i.e. each cluster is inner-balanced and independent from the others. As there are many trikes repositioning in a very large system simultaneously, clustering is necessary to reduce the problem complexity. Secondly, we allocate multiple trikes to each cluster to conduct inner-cluster bike reposition. A spatio-temporal reinforcement learning model is designed for each cluster to learn a reposition policy in it, targeting at minimizing its customer loss in a long period. To learn each model, we design a deep neural network to estimate its optimal long-term value function, from which the optimal policy can be easily inferred. Besides formulating the model in a multi-agent way, we further reduce its training complexity by two spatio-temporal pruning rules. Thirdly, we design a system simulator based on two predictors to train and evaluate the reposition model. Experiments on real-world datasets from Citi Bike are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of our model."

Recently, session-based recommendationsare becoming popular to explore the temporal characteristics of customers' interactive behaviors. However, existing works mainly exploit the short-term behaviors without fully taking the customers' long-term stable preferences and evolutions into account. In this paper, we propose a novel Behavior-Intensive Neural Network (BINN) for next-item recommendation by incorporating both users' historical stable preferences and present consumption motivations. Specifically, BINN contains two main components, i.e., Neural Item Embedding, and Discriminative Behaviors Learning. Firstly, a novel item embedding method based on user interactions is developed for obtaining an unified representation for each item. Then, with the embedded items and the interactive behaviors over item sequences, BINN discriminatively learns the historical preferences and present motivations of the target users. Thus, BINN could better perform recommendations of the next items for the target users. Finally, for evaluating the performances of BINN, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, i.e., Tianchi and JD. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of BINN compared with several state-of-the-art methods."

Hashing is a promising approach for accelerating these problems by orders of magnitude.

Manually crafting these features usually comes with high cost due to the variety, volume and velocity of raw data in web-scale systems. Factorization based models, which measure interactions in terms of vector product, can learn patterns of combinatorial features automatically and generalize to unseen features as well. With the great success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various fields, recently researchers have proposed several DNN-based factorization model to learn both low- and high-order feature interactions. Despite the powerful ability of learning an arbitrary function from data, plain DNNs generate feature interactions implicitly and at the bit-wise level.

It is a challenging task to design an effective fleet management strategy that can adapt to an environment involving complex dynamics between demand and supply. Existing studies usually work on a simplified problem setting that can hardly capture the complicated stochastic demand-supply variations in high-dimensional space. In this paper we propose to tackle the large-scale fleet management problem using reinforcement learning, and propose a contextual multi-agent reinforcement learning framework including two concrete algorithms, namely contextual deep Q-learning and contextual multi-agent actor-critic, to achieve explicit coordination among a large number of agents adaptive to different contexts.

In this paper, we present a comparative analysis between the two methods to illustrate their strengths and limitations when applied to two-level nested data. We provide a detailed analysis demonstrating the equivalence of their formulations under a mild condition from an optimization perspective. We also demonstrate their limitations in terms of their predictive performance and especially, their difficulty in identifying potential cross-scale interactions between the local and group-level features when applied to datasets with either a small number of groups or limited training examples per group. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method for disaggregating the coarse-scale values of the group-level features in the nested data. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data show that the disaggregated group-level features can help enhance the prediction accuracy of the models significantly and identify the cross-scale interactions more effectively."

Such dense vector representations offer great promises for many network analysis problems. However, existing NE approaches are still faced with challenges posed by the characteristics of complex networks in real-world applications. First, for many real-world networks associated with rich content information, previous NE methods tend to learn separated content and structure representations for each node, which requires a post-processing of combination. The empirical and simple combination strategies often make the final vector suboptimal. Second, the existing NE methods preserve the structure information by considering short and fixed neighborhood scope, such as the first- and/or the second-order proximities. However, it is hard to decide the scope of the neighborhood when facing a complex problem. To this end, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model based NE framework which is referred to as Self-Translation Network Embedding (STNE) model. With the sequences generated by random walks on a network, STNE learns the mapping that translates each sequence itself from the content sequence to the node sequence. On the one hand, the bi-directional LSTM encoder of STNE fuses the content and structure information seamlessly from the raw input. On the other hand, high-order proximity can be flexibly learned with the memories of LSTM to capture long-range structural information. By such self-translation from content to node, the learned hidden representations can be adopted as node embeddings. Extensive experimental results based on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed STNE outperforms the state-of-the-art NE approaches.

Existing efforts against adversaries are usually limited by the type of applied ML models or the specific applications such as image classification. Additionally, the working mechanisms of ML models usually cannot be well understood by users, which in turn impede them from understanding the vulnerabilities of models nor improving their robustness. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose to investigate whether model interpretation could potentially help adversarial detection. Specifically, we develop a novel adversary-resistant detection framework by utilizing the interpretation of ML models. The interpretation process explains the mechanism of how the target ML model makes prediction for a given instance, thus providing more insights for crafting adversarial samples. The robustness of detectors is then improved through adversarial training with the adversarial samples. A data-driven method is also developed to empirically estimate costs of adversaries in feature manipulation. Our approach is model-agnostic and can be applied to various types of classification models. Our experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of interpretation-based attacks and how estimated feature manipulation cost would affect the behavior of adversaries."

Each dimension in the embedding space usually does not have any specific meaning, thus it is difficult to comprehend how the embedding instances are distributed in the reconstructed space. In addition, heterogeneous content information may be incorporated into network embedding, so it is challenging to specify which source of information is effective in generating the embedding results. In this paper, we investigate the interpretation of network embedding, aiming to understand how instances are distributed in embedding space, as well as explore the factors that lead to the embedding results. We resort to the post-hoc interpretation scheme, so that our approach can be applied to different types of embedding methods. Specifically, the interpretation of network embedding is presented in the form of a taxonomy. Effective objectives and corresponding algorithms are developed towards building the taxonomy. We also design several metrics to evaluate interpretation results.

However, the problem of how to systematically exploit the rich semantic information embedded in multiple heterogenous data (e.g. texts and images) to precisely retrieve similar exercises remains pretty much open. To this end, in this paper, we develop a novel Multimodal Attention-based Neural Network (MANN) framework for finding similar exercises in large-scale online education systems by learning a unified semantic representation from the heterogenous data. In MANN, given exercises with texts, images and knowledge concepts, we first apply a convolutional neural network to extract image representations and use an embedding layer for representing concepts. Then, we design an attention-based long short-term memory network to learn a unified semantic representation of each exercise in a multimodal way. Here, two attention strategies are proposed to capture the associations of texts and images, texts and knowledge concepts, respectively. Moreover, with a Similarity Attention, the similar parts in each exercise pair are also measured. Finally, we develop a pairwise training strategy for returning similar exercises. Extensive experimental results on real-world data clearly validate the effectiveness and the interpretation power of MANN."

However, none of the existing approaches explicitly take the effects of users' current actions on their next moves into account. In this study, we argue that a long-term memory model may be insufficient for modeling long sessions that usually contain user interests drift caused by unintended clicks. A novel short-term attention/memory priority model is proposed as a remedy, which is capable of capturing users' general interests from the long-term memory of a session context, whilst taking into account users' current interests from the short-term memory of the last-clicks.

Previous IM models mainly focus on optimizing the spread of product consumption, which assumes that all users are potential customers and more exposures lead to better profit. However, in the real-world scenario, some people may not like the product and may express negative opinions after consuming, which damage the product reputation and harm the long-term profit. Only a portion of users in the social network, called the target user, is the potential customer that likes the product and will spread positive opinion. In this paper, we consider a problem called AcTive Opinion Maximization (ATOM), where the goal is to find a set of seed users to maximize the overall opinion spread toward a target product in a multi-round campaign. Different from previous works, we do not assume the user opinion is known before consumption, but should be derived from user preference data. The ATOM problem has essential applications in viral marketing, such as reputation building and precision advertising. Given its significance, ATOM problem is profoundly challenging due to the hardness of estimating user opinion in a multi-round campaign. Moreover, the process of opinion estimation and influence propagation intertwine with each other, which requires the model to consider the two components collectively.

However, due to the dynamic and complex nature of real-world information systems, learning a reliable invariant network in a new environment often requires continuous collecting and analyzing the system surveillance data for several weeks or even months.

The neighborhood structure of a vertex is usually closely related with an underlying hierarchical taxonomy---the vertices are associated with successively broader categories that can be organized hierarchically. The categories of different levels reflects similarity of different granularity. The hierarchy of the taxonomy therefore requires that the learned representations support multiple levels of granularity. Moreover, the hierarchical taxonomy enables the information to flow between vertices via their common categories, and thus provides an effective mechanism for alleviating data scarcity. However, incorporating the hierarchical taxonomy into network embedding poses a great challenge (since the taxonomy is generally unknown), and it is neglected by the existing approaches. In this paper, we propose NetHiex, a NETwork embedding model that captures the latent HIErarchical taXonomy. In our model, a vertex representation consists of multiple components that are associated with categories of different granularity. The representations of both the vertices and the categories are co-regularized. We employ the nested Chinese restaurant process to guide the search of the most plausible hierarchical taxonomy.

With multi-task learning, we aim to build a single model that learns these multiple goals and tasks simultaneously. However, the prediction quality of commonly used multi-task models is often sensitive to the relationships between tasks. It is therefore important to study the modeling tradeoffs between task-specific objectives and inter-task relationships. In this work, we propose a novel multi-task learning approach, Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE), which explicitly learns to model task relationships from data. We adapt the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure to multi-task learning by sharing the expert submodels across all tasks, while also having a gating network trained to optimize each task. To validate our approach on data with different levels of task relatedness, we first apply it to a synthetic dataset where we control the task relatedness.

In addition, xStream can address the outlier detection problem for the (less general) disk-resident static as well as row-streaming settings. We evaluate xStream rigorously on numerous real-life datasets in all three settings: static, row-stream, and feature-evolving stream. Experiments under static and row-streaming scenarios show that xStream is as competitive as state-of-the-art detectors and particularly effective in high-dimensions with noise. We also demonstrate that our solution is fast and accurate with modest space overhead for evolving streams, on which there exists no competition."

Each grouping represents a different view of the data set. The new research field of non-redundant clustering addresses this class of problems. In this paper, we follow the approach that different, non-redundant k-means-like clusterings may exist in different, arbitrarily oriented subspaces of the high-dimensional space. We assume that these subspaces (and optionally a further noise space without any cluster structure) are orthogonal to each other. This assumption enables a particularly rigorous mathematical treatment of the non-redundant clustering problem and thus a particularly efficient algorithm, which we call Nr-Kmeans (for non-redundant k-means). The superiority of our algorithm is demonstrated both theoretically, as well as in extensive experiments."

However, a significant portion of the data stream literature assumes that actual labels are instantaneously available after issuing their corresponding classifications. In this paper, we explore a different set of assumptions without relying on the availability of class labels. We assume that, although the distribution of the data may change over time, it will switch between one of a handful of well-known distributions. Still, we allow the proportions of the classes to vary. In these conditions, we propose the first method that can accurately identify the correct context of data samples and simultaneously estimate the proportion of the positive class. This estimate can be further used to adjust a classification decision threshold and improve classification accuracy. Finally, the method is very efficient regarding time and memory requirements, fitting data stream applications."

Na, Donghyun Kim, Hwanjo Yu, ","With precipitously growing demand to detect outliers in data streams, many studies have been conducted aiming to develop extensions of well-known outlier detection algorithm called Local Outlier Factor (LOF), for data streams. However, existing LOF-based algorithms for data streams still suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Large amount of memory space is required. 2) A long sequence of outliers is not detected. In this paper, we propose a new outlier detection algorithm for data streams, called DILOF that effectively overcomes the limitations. To this end, we first develop a novel density-based sampling algorithm to summarize past data and then propose a new strategy for detecting a sequence of outliers. It is worth noting that our proposing algorithms do not require any prior knowledge or assumptions on data distribution. Moreover, we accelerate the execution time of DILOF about 15 times by developing a powerful distance approximation technique. Our comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DILOF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in terms of accuracy and execution time. The source code for the proposed algorithm is available at our website: http://di.postech.ac.kr/DILOF."

However, most kernel methods, including the state-of-the-art LIBSVM, are vulnerable to the curse of kernelization, making them infeasible to apply to large-scale datasets. This issue is exacerbated when kernel methods are used in conjunction with a grid search to tune their kernel parameters and hyperparameters which brings in the question of model robustness when applied to real datasets. In this paper, we propose a robust Bayesian Kernel Machine (BKM) - a Bayesian kernel machine that exploits the strengths of both the Bayesian modelling and kernel methods. A key challenge for such a formulation is the need for an efficient learning algorithm. To this end, we successfully extended the recent Stein variational theory for Bayesian inference for our proposed model, resulting in fast and efficient learning and prediction algorithms. Importantly our proposed BKM is resilient to the curse of kernelization, hence making it applicable to large-scale datasets and robust to parameter tuning, avoiding the associated expense and potential pitfalls with current practice of parameter tuning. Our extensive experimental results on 12 benchmark datasets show that our BKM without tuning any parameter can achieve comparable predictive performance with the state-of-the-art LIBSVM and significantly outperforms other baselines, while obtaining significantly speedup in terms of the total training time compared with its rivals"

Computationally, as proposed model has a nonsmooth loss function and a non-convex regularization term, we construct an efcient re-weighted method to optimize it. Theoretically, we frst present the convergence analysis of constructed method, and then prove that the derived solution is a stationary point of original problem.

Besides, we show that direct applying Procrustes Average (PA) in multiview tasks may not be optimal theoretically and empirically, since it does not take the clustering capacity differences of different views into consideration. Other than that, we propose an Adaptively Weighted Procrustes (AWP) approach to overcome the aforementioned deficiency. Our new AWP weights views with their clustering capacities and forms a weighted Procrustes Average problem accordingly. The optimization algorithm to solve the new model is computational complexity analyzed and convergence guaranteed.

There are a few graph upscaling methods such as Gscaler, they still fail to preserve important properties of the original graph and fail to upscale due to out of memory or too long runtime. In this paper, we propose a novel graph upscaling method called EvoGraph that can upscale the original graph with preserving its properties regardless of a scale factor. It determines and attaches new edges to the real graph using the preferential attachment mechanism in an effective and efficient way.

We propose a novel approach for extracting explanations from latent factor recommendation systems by training association rules on the output of a matrix factorisation black-box model. By taking advantage of the interpretable structure of association rules, we demonstrate that predictive accuracy of the recommendation model can be maintained whilst yielding explanations with high fidelity to the black-box model on a unique industry dataset. Our approach mitigates the accuracy-interpretability trade-off whilst avoiding the need to sacrifice flexibility or use external data sources.

Papalexakis, Haesun Park, ","This paper presents a new method, which we call SUSTain, that extends real-valued matrix and tensor factorizations to data where values are integers. Such data are common when the values correspond to event counts or ordinal measures. The conventional approach is to treat integer data as real, and then apply real-valued factorizations. However, doing so fails to preserve important characteristics of the original data, thereby making it hard to interpret the results. Instead, our approach extracts factor values from integer datasets as scores that are constrained to take values from a small integer set. These scores are easy to interpret: a score of zero indicates no feature contribution and higher scores indicate distinct levels of feature importance. At its core, SUSTain relies on: a) a problem partitioning into integer-constrained subproblems, so that they can be optimally solved in an efficient manner; and b) organizing the order of the subproblems' solution, to promote reuse of shared intermediate results. We propose two variants, SUSTain_M and SUSTain_T, to handle both matrix and tensor inputs, respectively. We evaluate SUSTain against several state-of-the-art baselines on both synthetic and real Electronic Health Record (EHR) datasets. Comparing to those baselines, SUSTain shows either significantly better fit or orders of magnitude speedups that achieve a comparable fit (up to 425× faster).

Furthermore, 87% of them were validated as clinically meaningful phenotypes related to heart failure by a cardiologist."

Generally speaking, there are two types of missing values: explicitly missing values (i.e. NULL values), and implicitly missing values (a.k.a. disguised missing values (DMVs)) such as ""11111111"" for a phone number and ""Some college"" for education. While detecting explicitly missing values is trivial, detecting DMVs is not; the essential challenge is the lack of standardization about how DMVs are generated. In this paper, we present FAHES, a robust system for detecting DMVs from two angles: DMVs as detectable outliers and as detectable inliers. For DMVs as outliers, we propose a syntactic outlier detection module for categorical data, and a density-based outlier detection module for numerical values. For DMVs as inliers, we propose a method that detects DMVs which follow either missing-completely-at-random or missing-at-random models. The robustness of FAHES is achieved through an ensemble technique that is inspired by outlier ensembles. Our extensive experiments using real-world data sets show that FAHES delivers better results than existing solutions."

A K -dimensional ES is a set of K -tuples to specify K -dimensional sequences that are considered equivalent. Whether or not two K -dimensional sequences are equivalent is decided based on comparisons of all of their subsequences. ES extraction can be used for preprocessing for transfer learning or imitation learning, as well as an analysis of multidimensional sequences. A recently proposed method called incremental search (IS) was much faster than brute-force search. However, IS can still take a long time to obtain ESs, because ESs obtained by IS can be subsets of other ESs and such subsets must be removed in the process. In this paper, we propose a new fast method called pairwise incremental search (PIS). In the process of PIS, the aforementioned problem about subsets of ESs does not exist, because the elements of ESs are searched pairwise. As shown by results of two experiments we conducted, PIS was 48 times faster than IS in an experiment using synthetic datasets and 171 times faster in an experiment using motion capture datasets."

The refined vector enables efficient implementation of exhaustive similarity computation with bit-wise operations, followed by a near-lossless k-NN selection algorithm, also proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithms are integrated into an end-to-end multi-GPU system that retrieves thousands of top items from over a billion candidates in real-time. The RBE model and the retrieval system were evaluated with data from a major paid search engine. When measured against the state-of-the-art model for binary representation and the full precision model for semantic embedding, RBE significantly outperformed the former, and filled in over 80% of the AUC gap in-between. Experiments comparing with our production retrieval system also demonstrated superior performance. While the primary focus of this paper is to build RBE based on a particular class of semantic models, generalizing to other types is straightforward, as exemplified by two different models at the end of the paper."

As the manual taxonomy curation costs enormous human effects, automatic taxonomy construction is in great demand. However, most existing automatic taxonomy construction methods can only build hypernymy taxonomies wherein each edge is limited to expressing the is-a relation. Such a restriction limits their applicability to more diverse real-world tasks where the parent-child may carry different relations. In this paper, we aim to construct a task-guided taxonomy from a domain-specific corpus, and allow users to input a seed taxonomy, serving as the task guidance. We propose an expansion-based taxonomy construction framework, namely HiExpan, which automatically generates key term list from the corpus and iteratively grows the seed taxonomy. Specifically, HiExpan views all children under each taxonomy node forming a coherent set and builds the taxonomy by recursively expanding all these sets. Furthermore, HiExpan incorporates a weakly-supervised relation extraction module to extract the initial children of a newly-expanded node and adjusts the taxonomy tree by optimizing its global structure. Our experiments on three real datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of HiExpan for building task-guided taxonomies."

In the meantime, network embedding has emerged as a convenient tool to mine and learn from networked data. As a result, it is of interest to develop HIN embedding methods. However, the heterogeneity in HINs introduces not only rich information but also potentially incompatible semantics, which poses special challenges to embedding learning in HINs. With the intention to preserve the rich yet potentially incompatible information in HIN embedding, we propose to study the problem of comprehensive transcription of heterogeneous information networks. The comprehensive transcription of HINs also provides an easy-to-use approach to unleash the power of HINs, since it requires no additional supervision, expertise, or feature engineering. To cope with the challenges in the comprehensive transcription of HINs, we propose the HEER algorithm, which embeds HINs via edge representations that are further coupled with properly-learned heterogeneous metrics. To corroborate the efficacy of HEER, we conducted experiments on two large-scale real-words datasets with an edge reconstruction task and multiple case studies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HEER model and the utility of edge representations and heterogeneous metrics.

In particular, the feedback will be used to adjust the anomaly ranking after every analyst interaction, ideally moving anomalies of interest closer to the top. Our main contribution is to formulate this problem within the framework of online convex optimization, which yields an efficient and extremely simple approach to incorporating feedback compared to the prior state-of-the-art. We instantiate this approach for the powerful class of tree-based anomaly detectors and conduct experiments on a range of benchmark datasets.

To address these often conflicting responsibilities, we propose a conceptual and computational framework that allows the formulation of fairness constraints on rankings in terms of exposure allocation. As part of this framework, we develop efficient algorithms for finding rankings that maximize the utility for the user while provably satisfying a specifiable notion of fairness. Since fairness goals can be application specific, we show how a broad range of fairness constraints can be implemented using our framework, including forms of demographic parity, disparate treatment, and disparate impact constraints.

Building such a system, however, is challenging since it requires a compact representation of the raw time series which can explicitly encode the temporal dynamics as well as the correlations (interactions) between different pairs of time series (sensors). Furthermore, it requires query efficiency and expects a returned ranking list with high precision on the top. Despite the fact that various approaches have been developed, few of them can jointly resolve these two challenges. To cope with this issue, in this paper we propose a Deep r-th root of Rank Supervised Joint Binary Embedding (Deep r-RSJBE) to perform multivariate time series retrieval. Given a raw multivariate time series segment, we employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to encode the temporal dynamics and utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to encode the correlations (interactions) between different pairs of time series (sensors). Subsequently, a joint binary embedding is pursued to incorporate both the temporal dynamics and the correlations. Finally, we develop a novel r-th root ranking loss to optimize the precision at the top of a Hamming distance ranking list. Thoroughly empirical studies based upon three publicly available time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of Deep r-RSJBE."

Our core idea is to use existing inequality indices from economics to measure how unequally the outcomes of an algorithm benefit different individuals or groups in a population. Our work offers a justified and general framework to compare and contrast the (un)fairness of algorithmic predictors. This unifying approach enables us to quantify unfairness both at the individual and the group level. Further, our work reveals overlooked tradeoffs between different fairness notions: using our proposed measures, the overall individual-level unfairness of an algorithm can be decomposed into a between-group and a within-group component. Earlier methods are typically designed to tackle only between-group un- fairness, which may be justified for legal or other reasons. However, we demonstrate that minimizing exclusively the between-group component may, in fact, increase the within-group, and hence the overall unfairness. We characterize and illustrate the tradeoffs between our measures of (un)fairness and the prediction accuracy."

Yu, Wei Chen, ","In this paper, we study the Multi-Round Influence Maximization (MRIM) problem, where influence propagates in multiple rounds independently from possibly different seed sets, and the goal is to select seeds for each round to maximize the expected number of nodes that are activated in at least one round. MRIM problem models the viral marketing scenarios in which advertisers conduct multiple rounds of viral marketing to promote one product. We consider two different settings: 1) the non-adaptive MRIM, where the advertiser needs to determine the seed sets for all rounds at the very beginning, and 2) the adaptive MRIM, where the advertiser can select seed sets adaptively based on the propagation results in the previous rounds. For the non-adaptive setting, we design two algorithms that exhibit an interesting tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness: a cross-round greedy algorithm that selects seeds at a global level and achieves $1/2 - \varepsilon$ approximation ratio, and a within-round greedy algorithm that selects seeds round by round and achieves $1-e^-(1-1/e) -\varepsilon \approx 0.46 - \varepsilon$ approximation ratio but saves running time by a factor related to the number of rounds. For the adaptive setting, we design an adaptive algorithm that guarantees $1-e^-(1-1/e) -\varepsilon$ approximation to the adaptive optimal solution. In all cases, we further design scalable algorithms based on the reverse influence sampling approach and achieve near-linear running time. We conduct experiments on several real-world networks and demonstrate that our algorithms are effective for the MRIM task."

Baytas, Liang Zhan, Zhangyang Wang, Jiayu Zhou, ","Over the past decade a wide spectrum of machine learning models have been developed to model the neurodegenerative diseases, associating biomarkers, especially non-intrusive neuroimaging markers, with key clinical scores measuring the cognitive status of patients. Multi-task learning (MTL) has been commonly utilized by these studies to address high dimensionality and small cohort size challenges. However, most existing MTL approaches are based on linear models and suffer from two major limitations: 1) they cannot explicitly consider upper/lower bounds in these clinical scores; 2) they lack the capability to capture complicated non-linear interactions among the variables. In this paper, we propose Subspace Network, an efficient deep modeling approach for non-linear multi-task censored regression. Each layer of the subspace network performs a multi-task censored regression to improve upon the predictions from the last layer via sketching a low-dimensional subspace to perform knowledge transfer among learning tasks. Under mild assumptions, for each layer the parametric subspace can be recovered using only one pass of training data. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed subspace network quickly picks up the correct parameter subspaces, and outperforms state-of-the-arts in predicting neurodegenerative clinical scores using information in brain imaging."

Indeed, at the macro level, ROI is one of the representatives for agglomeration economies, and plays an important role in urban business planning. At the micro level, ROI provides a useful venue for understanding the urban lives, demands and mobilities of people. However, due to the vague and diversified nature of ROI, it still lacks of quantitative ways to investigate ROIs in a holistic manner. To this end, in this paper we propose a systematic study on ROI analysis through mining the large-scale online map query logs, which provides a new data-driven research paradigm for ROI detection and profiling. Specifically, we first divide the urban area into small region grids, and calculate their PageRank value as visiting popularity based on the transition information extracted from map queries. Then, we propose a density-based clustering method for merging neighboring region grids with high popularity into integrated ROIs. After that, to further explore the profiles of different ROIs, we develop a spatial-temporal latent factor model URPTM (Urban Roi Profiling Topic Model) to identify the latent travel patterns and Point-of-Interest (POI) demands of ROI visitors. Finally, we implement extensive experiments to empirically evaluate our approaches based on the large-scale real-world data collected from Beijing. Indeed, by visualizing the results obtained from URPTM, we can successfully obtain many meaningful travel patterns and interesting discoveries on urban lives."

For example, if a data scientist performs an analysis in 2017 that saves a significant amount of money, then she will likely to be asked to perform the same analysis on data from 2018. But more data analyses means more effort spent in data wrangling. We introduce the data diff problem, which attempts to turn this problem into an opportunity. Comparing the repeated data samples against each other, inconsistencies may be indicative of underlying issues in data quality. By analogy to text \textttdiff, the data diff problem is to find a ""patch"", that is, transformation in a specified domain-specific language, that transforms the data samples so that they are identically distributed.

Knowledge distillation (KD) was shown to be successful in image recognition to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency. We propose a KD technique for learning to rank problems, called ranking distillation (RD). Specifically, we train a smaller student model to learn to rank documents/items from both the training data and the supervision of a larger teacher model. The student model achieves a similar ranking performance to that of the large teacher model, but its smaller model size makes the online inference more efficient. RD is flexible because it is orthogonal to the choices of ranking models for the teacher and student. We address the challenges of RD for ranking problems. The experiments on public data sets and state-of-the-art recommendation models showed that RD achieves its design purposes: the student model learnt with RD has less than an half size of the teacher model while achieving a ranking performance similar tothe teacher model and much better than the student model learnt without RD."

This paper investigates the novel use of attention as a form of feature augmentation, i.e, casted attention. We propose Multi-Cast Attention Networks (MCAN), a new attention mechanism and general model architecture for a potpourri of ranking tasks in the conversational modeling and question answering domains. Our approach performs a series of soft attention operations, each time casting a scalar feature upon the inner word embeddings. The key idea is to provide a real-valued hint (feature) to a subsequent encoder layer and is targeted at improving the representation learning process. There are several advantages to this design, e.g., it allows an arbitrary number of attention mechanisms to be casted, allowing for multiple attention types (e.g., co-attention, intra-attention) and attention variants (e.g., alignment-pooling, max-pooling, mean-pooling) to be executed simultaneously. This not only eliminates the costly need to tune the nature of the co-attention layer, but also provides greater extents of explainability to practitioners. Via extensive experiments on four well-known benchmark datasets, we show that MCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus, MCAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art models by 9%. MCAN also achieves the best performing score to date on the well-studied TrecQA dataset."

This paper proposes a new neural architecture for recommendation with reviews. Our model operates on a multi-hierarchical paradigm and is based on the intuition that not all reviews are created equal, i.e., only a selected few are important. The importance, however, should be dynamically inferred depending on the current target. To this end, we propose a review-by-review pointer-based learning scheme that extracts important reviews from user and item reviews and subsequently matches them in a word-by-word fashion. This enables not only the most informative reviews to be utilized for prediction but also a deeper word-level interaction. Our pointer-based method operates with a gumbel-softmax based pointer mechanism that enables the incorporation of discrete vectors within differentiable neural architectures. Our pointer mechanism is co-attentive in nature, learning pointers which are co-dependent on user-item relationships. Finally, we propose a multi-pointer learning scheme that learns to combine multiple views of user-item interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model via extensive experiments on 24 benchmark datasets from Amazon and Yelp. Empirical results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, with up to 19% and 71% relative improvement when compared to TransNet and DeepCoNN respectively. We study the behavior of our multi-pointer learning mechanism, shedding light on 'evidence aggregation' patterns in review-based recommender systems."

It can estimate the count of any item in a stream using a small, fixed size data sketch. However, the accuracy of the Count-Min sketch depends on characteristics of the underlying data. This has led to a number of count estimation procedures which work well in one scenario but perform poorly in others. A practitioner is faced with two basic, unanswered questions. Given an estimate, what is its error? Which estimation procedure should be chosen when the data is unknown? We provide answers to these questions. We derive new count estimators, including a provably optimal estimator, which best or match previous estimators in all scenarios. We also provide practical, tight error bounds at query time for all estimators and methods to tune sketch parameters using these bounds. The key observation is that the full distribution of errors in each counter can be empirically estimated from the sketch itself. By first estimating this distribution, count estimation becomes a statistical estimation and inference problem with a known error distribution. This provides both a principled way to derive new and optimal estimators as well as a way to study the error and properties of existing estimators."

This has been an outstanding issue for about two decades which hampered the development of kernel-based methods. We introduce Isolation Kernel which is solely dependent on data distribution, requiring neither class information nor explicit learning to be a classifier. In contrast, existing data dependent kernels rely heavily on class information and explicit learning to produce a classifier. We show that Isolation Kernel approximates well to a data independent kernel function called Laplacian kernel under uniform density distribution. With this revelation, Isolation Kernel can be viewed as a data dependent kernel that adapts a data independent kernel to the structure of a dataset. We also provide a reason why the proposed new data dependent kernel enables SVM (which employs a kernel through other means) to improve its predictive accuracy. The key differences between Random Forest kernel and Isolation Kernel are discussed to examine the reasons why the latter is a more successful tree-based kernel."

These processes have the peculiarity of evolving over time and of comprising latent factors, which influence the system without being explicitly measured. In this work we present latent variable time-varying graphical lasso (LTGL), a method for multivariate time-series graphical modelling that considers the influence of hidden or unmeasurable factors. The estimation of the contribution of the latent factors is embedded in the model which produces both sparse and low-rank components for each time point. In particular, the first component represents the connectivity structure of observable variables of the system, while the second represents the influence of hidden factors, assumed to be few with respect to the observed variables. Our model includes temporal consistency on both components, providing an accurate evolutionary pattern of the system. We derive a tractable optimisation algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers, and develop a scalable and efficient implementation which exploits proximity operators in closed form. LTGL is extensively validated on synthetic data, achieving optimal performance in terms of accuracy, structure learning and scalability with respect to ground truth and state-of-the-art methods for graphical inference. We conclude with the application of LTGL to real case studies, from biology and finance, to illustrate how our method can be successfully employed to gain insights on multivariate time-series data."

However, it is a hard task in terms of the expressiveness of the employed similarity measure and the efficiency of its computation. Ideally, graph comparison should be invariant to the order of nodes and the sizes of compared graphs, adaptive to the scale of graph patterns, and scalable. Unfortunately, these properties have not been addressed together. Graph comparisons still rely on direct approaches, graph kernels, or representation-based methods, which are all inefficient and impractical for large graph collections. In this paper, we propose the Network Laplacian Spectral Descriptor (NetLSD): the first, to our knowledge, permutation- and size-invariant, scale-adaptive, and efficiently computable graph representation method that allows for straightforward comparisons of large graphs. NetLSD extracts a compact signature that inherits the formal properties of the Laplacian spectrum, specifically its heat or wave kernel; thus, it \em hears the shape of a graph. Our evaluation on a variety of real-world graphs demonstrates that it outperforms previous works in both expressiveness and efficiency."

Existing approaches usually define the similarity by direct links or common neighborhoods between nodes, i.e. structural equivalence. However, vertexes which reside in different parts of the network may have similar roles or positions, i.e. regular equivalence, which is largely ignored by the literature of network embedding. Regular equivalence is defined in a recursive way that two regularly equivalent vertexes have network neighbors which are also regularly equivalent. Accordingly, we propose a new approach named Deep Recursive Network Embedding (DRNE) to learn network embeddings with regular equivalence. More specifically, we propose a layer normalized LSTM to represent each node by aggregating the representations of their neighborhoods in a recursive way. We theoretically prove that some popular and typical centrality measures which are consistent with regular equivalence are optimal solutions of our model. This is also demonstrated by empirical results that the learned node representations can well predict the indexes of regular equivalence and related centrality scores. Furthermore, the learned node representations can be directly used for end applications like structural role classification in networks, and the experimental results show that our method can consistently outperform centrality-based methods and other state-of-the-art network embedding methods."

We present methodology and a framework to answer these questions based on meta-learning across many datasets. We apply this methodology using the experimental meta-data available on OpenML to determine the most important hyperparameters of support vector machines, random forests and Adaboost, and to infer priors for all their hyperparameters. The results, obtained fully automatically, provide a quantitative basis to focus efforts in both manual algorithm design and in automated hyperparameter optimization.

For DL to pervade Science and Engineering (S&EE) applications where risk management is a core component, well-characterized uncertainty estimates must accompany predictions. However, S&E observations and model-simulations often follow heavily skewed distributions and are not well modeled with DL approaches, since they usually optimize a Gaussian, or Euclidean, likelihood loss. Recent developments in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL), which attempts to capture uncertainties from noisy observations, aleatoric, and from unknown model parameters, epistemic, provide us a foundation. Here we present a discrete-continuous BDL model with Gaussian and lognormal likelihoods for uncertainty quantification (UQ). We demonstrate the approach by developing UQ estimates on ""DeepSD'', a super-resolution based DL model for Statistical Downscaling (SD) in climate applied to precipitation, which follows an extremely skewed distribution. We find that the discrete-continuous models outperform a basic Gaussian distribution in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration. Furthermore, we find that the lognormal distribution, which can handle skewed distributions, produces quality uncertainty estimates at the extremes. Such results may be important across S&E, as well as other domains such as finance and economics, where extremes are often of significant interest. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first UQ model in SD where both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties are characterized."

The deviation is measured by $\ell1$ or $\ell2$ distance. The exact approach is to query the full table to calculate the deviation for each attribute and then sort them. It is too expensive for large tables. Researchers have proposed heuristic sampling solutions to avoid accessing the entire table for all attributes. However, these solutions have no theoretical guarantee of correctness and their speedup over the exact approach is limited. In this paper, we develop an adaptive querying solution with probabilistic guarantee of correctness and near-optimal sample complexity. We perform experiments in both synthetic and real-world datasets. Compared to the exact approach implemented with a commercial DBMS, previous sampling solutions achieve up to 2× speedup with erroneous answers.

The cloud-based solution is a promising approach to enabling deep learning applications on mobile devices where the large portions of a DNN are offloaded to the cloud. However, revealing data to the cloud leads to potential privacy risk. To benefit from the cloud data center without the privacy risk, we design, evaluate, and implement a cloud-based framework ARDEN which partitions the DNN across mobile devices and cloud data centers. A simple data transformation is performed on the mobile device, while the resource-hungry training and the complex inference rely on the cloud data center. To protect the sensitive information, a lightweight privacy-preserving mechanism consisting of arbitrary data nullification and random noise addition is introduced, which provides strong privacy guarantee. A rigorous privacy budget analysis is given. Nonetheless, the private perturbation to the original data inevitably has a negative impact on the performance of further inference on the cloud side. To mitigate this influence, we propose a noisy training method to enhance the cloud-side network robustness to perturbed data. Through the sophisticated design, ARDEN can not only preserve privacy but also improve the inference performance. To validate the proposed ARDEN, a series of experiments based on three image datasets and a real mobile application are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ARDEN.

In particular, we propose a regularization penalty, expert yielded estimates (EYE), that incorporates expert knowledge about well-known relationships among covariates and the outcome of interest. We give both theoretical and empirical results comparing our proposed method to several other regularization techniques. Across a range of settings, experiments on both synthetic and real data show that models learned using the EYE penalty are significantly more credible than those learned using other penalties.

It is well-known that the problem of class-imbalance stands as a major factor affecting the generalization performance of multi-class classifier, and this problem becomes more pronounced as the ground-truth label of each PL training example is not directly accessible to the learning approach. To mitigate the negative influence of class-imbalance to partial label learning, a novel class-imbalance aware approach named CIMAP is proposed by adapting over-sampling techniques for handling PL training examples. Firstly, for each PL training example, CIMAP disambiguates its candidate label set by estimating the confidence of each class label being ground-truth one via weighted k-nearest neighbor aggregation. After that, the original PL training set is replenished for model induction by over-sampling existing PL training examples via manipulation of the disambiguation results. Extensive experiments on artificial as well as real-world PL data sets show that CIMAP serves as an effective data-level approach to mitigate the class-imbalance problem for partial label learning."

In light of this, in this paper we propose a wavelet-based neural network structure called multilevel Wavelet Decomposition Network (mWDN) for building frequency-aware deep learning models for time series analysis. mWDN preserves the advantage of multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition in frequency learning while enables the fine-tuning of all parameters under a deep neural network framework. Based on mWDN, we further propose two deep learning models called Residual Classification Flow (RCF) and multi-frequecy Long Short-Term Memory (mLSTM) for time series classification and forecasting, respectively. The two models take all or partial mWDN decomposed sub-series in different frequencies as input, and resort to the back propagation algorithm to learn all the parameters globally, which enables seamless embedding of wavelet-based frequency analysis into deep learning frameworks. Extensive experiments on 40 UCR datasets and a real-world user volume dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of our time series models based on mWDN. In particular, we propose an importance analysis method to mWDN based models, which successfully identifies those time-series elements and mWDN layers that are crucially important to time series analysis.

However, none of these studies have considered to combine the benefits of supervised learning and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning with Recurrent Neural Network (SRL-RNN), which fuses them into a synergistic learning framework. Specifically, SRL-RNN applies an off-policy actor-critic framework to handle complex relations among multiple medications, diseases and individual characteristics. The ""actor'' in the framework is adjusted by both the indicator signal and evaluation signal to ensure effective prescription and low mortality. RNN is further utilized to solve the Partially-Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problem due to lack of fully observed states in real world applications.

Analyzing driving behavior can help us assess driver performances, improve traffic safety, and, ultimately, promote the development of intelligent and resilient transportation systems. While some efforts have been made for analyzing driving behavior, existing methods can be improved via representation learning by jointly exploring the peer and temporal dependencies of driving behavior. To that end, in this paper, we develop a Peer and Temporal-Aware Representation Learning based framework (PTARL) for driving behavior analysis with GPS trajectory data. Specifically, we first detect the driving operations and states of each driver from GPS traces. Then, we derive a sequence of multi-view driving state transition graphs from the driving state sequences, in order to characterize a driver's driving behavior that varies over time. In addition, we develop a peer and temporal-aware representation learning method to learn a sequence of time-varying yet relational vectorized representations from the driving state transition graphs. The proposed method can simultaneously model both the graph-graph peer dependency and the current-past temporal dependency in a unified optimization framework. Also, we provide effective solutions for the optimization problem. Moreover, we exploit the learned representations of driving behavior to score driving performances and detect dangerous regions.

It is more realistic and practical to study recommender systems with inputs of streaming data. User-generated streaming data presents unique properties such as temporally ordered, continuous and high-velocity, which poses tremendous new challenges for the once very successful recommendation techniques. Although a few temporal or sequential recommender models have recently been developed based on recurrent neural models, most of them can only be applied to the session-based recommendation scenario, due to their short-term memories and the limited capability of capturing users' long-term stable interests. In this paper, we propose a streaming recommender model based on neural memory networks with external memories to capture and store both long-term stable interests and short-term dynamic interests in a unified way. An adaptive negative sampling framework based on Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) is developed to optimize our proposed streaming recommender model, which effectively overcomes the limitations of classical negative sampling approaches and improves both effectiveness and efficiency of the model parameter inference.

In contrast to directly recognizing subtle weights or filters as redundant in a given CNN, this paper presents an evolutionary method to automatically eliminate redundant convolution filters. We represent each compressed network as a binary individual of specific fitness. Then, the population is upgraded at each evolutionary iteration using genetic operations. As a result, an extremely compact CNN is generated using the fittest individual, which has the original network structure and can be directly deployed in any off-the-shelf deep learning libraries. In this approach, either large or small convolution filters can be redundant, and filters in the compressed network are more distinct. In addition, since the number of filters in each convolutional layer is reduced, the number of filter channels and the size of feature maps are also decreased, naturally improving both the compression and speed-up ratios. Experiments on benchmark deep CNN models suggest the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art compression methods, e.g. combined with the parameter refining approach, we can reduce the storage requirement and the floating-point multiplications of ResNet-50 by a factor of 14.64x and 5.19x, respectively, without affecting its accuracy."

However, dilated convolutions suffer from the gridding artifacts, which hampers the performance of DCNNs with dilated convolutions. In this work, we propose two simple yet effective degridding methods by studying a decomposition of dilated convolutions. Unlike existing models, which explore solutions by focusing on a block of cascaded dilated convolutional layers, our methods address the gridding artifacts by smoothing the dilated convolution itself. By analyzing them in both the original operation and the decomposition views, we further point out that the two degridding approaches are intrinsically related and define separable and shared (SS) operations, which generalize the proposed methods. We evaluate our methods thoroughly on two datasets and visualize the smoothing effect through effective receptive field analysis. Experimental results show that our methods yield significant and consistent improvements on the performance of DCNNs with dilated convolutions, while adding negligible amounts of extra training parameters."

However, existing studies have not yet tested the methods on the real-world traffic data and they only focus on studying the rewards without interpreting the policies. In this paper, we propose a more effective deep reinforcement learning model for traffic light control. We test our method on a large-scale real traffic dataset obtained from surveillance cameras.

However, it does not scale well to large-scale problems due to its quadratic complexity in constructing similarity graphs and computing subsequent eigendecomposition. Although a number of methods have been proposed to accelerate spectral clustering, most of them compromise considerable information loss in the original data for reducing computational bottlenecks. In this paper, we present a novel scalable spectral clustering method using Random Binning features (RB) to simultaneously accelerate both similarity graph construction and the eigendecomposition. Specifically, we implicitly approximate the graph similarity (kernel) matrix by the inner product of a large sparse feature matrix generated by RB. Then we introduce a state-of-the-art SVD solver to effectively compute eigenvectors of this large matrix for spectral clustering. Using these two building blocks, we reduce the computational cost from quadratic to linear in the number of data points while achieving similar accuracy. Our theoretical analysis shows that spectral clustering via RB converges faster to the exact spectral clustering than the standard Random Feature approximation. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks show that the proposed method either outperforms or matches the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and runtime. Moreover, our method exhibits linear scalability in both the number of data samples and the number of RB features."

We describe the factorial marked point processes whereby time-stamped event is factored into multiple markers. Accordingly the size of the infectivity matrix modeling the effect between pairwise markers is in exponential order regarding the number of discrete markers. We propose a decoupled learning method with two learning procedures: i) directly solving the model based on two techniques: Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers and Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm; ii) involving a reformulation that transforms the original problem into a Logistic Regression model for more efficient learning. Moreover, a sparse group regularizer is added to identify the key profile features and event labels. Empirical results on real world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our decoupled and reformulated method."

However, they may digitally unfairly treat unwanted groups, raising concerns about fairness and discrimination. In this paper, we study the fairness-aware ranking problem which aims to discover discrimination in ranked datasets and reconstruct the fair ranking. Existing methods in fairness-aware ranking are mainly based on statistical parity that cannot measure the true discriminatory effect since discrimination is causal. On the other hand, existing methods in causal-based anti-discrimination learning focus on classification problems and cannot be directly applied to handle the ranked data. To address these limitations, we propose to map the rank position to a continuous score variable that represents the qualification of the candidates. Then, we build a causal graph that consists of both the discrete profile attributes and the continuous score. The path-specific effect technique is extended to the mixed-variable causal graph to identify both direct and indirect discrimination. The relationship between the path-specific effects for the ranked data and those for the binary decision is theoretically analyzed. Finally, algorithms for discovering and removing discrimination from a ranked dataset are developed. Experiments using the real-world dataset show the effectiveness of our approaches."

Partial order class dependency is incorporated in the hidden class layer with a reverse tree structure. We also investigate computational algorithms for reverse tree construction, model parameter learning and class inference. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real world datasets show that proposed model outperforms multiple baselines in flood mapping, and our algorithms are scalable on large data sizes."

Most existing metric learning methods aim to learn an optimal Mahalanobis distance matrix M, under which data samples from the same class are forced to be close to each other and those from different classes are pushed far away. The Mahalanobis distance matrix M can be factorized as M = L'L, and the Mahalanobis distance induced by L is equivalent to the Euclidean distance after linear projection of the feature vectors on the rows of L. However, the Euclidean distance is only suitable for characterizing Gaussian noise, thus the traditional metric learning algorithms are not robust to achieve good performance when they are applied to the occlusion data, which often appear in image and video data mining applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new robust metric learning approach by introducing the maximum correntropy criterion to deal with real-world malicious occlusions or corruptions. In our new model, we enforce the intra-class reconstruction residual of each sample to be smaller than the inter-class reconstruction residual by a large margin. Meanwhile, we employ correntropy induced metric to fit the reconstruction residual, which has been proved to be useful in non-Gaussian data processing. Leveraging the half-quadratic optimization technique, we derive an efficient algorithm to solve the proposed new model and provide its convergence guarantee as well. Extensive experiments on various occluded data sets indicate that our proposed model can achieve more promising performance than other related methods."

The arrival of big data era reveals the feasibility to create a conversational system empowered by data-driven approaches. Now we are able to collect an extremely large number of human-human conversations on Web, and organize them to launch human-computer conversational systems. Given a human issued utterance, i.e., a query, a conversational system will search for appropriate responses, conduct relevance ranking using contexts information, and then output the highly relevant result. In this paper, we propose a novel context modeling framework with end-to-end neural networks for human-computer conversational systems. The proposed model is general and unified.

To address this issue, we propose a novel data structure named HeavyGuardian. The key idea is to intelligently separate and guard the information of hot items while approximately record the frequencies of cold items. We deploy HeavyGuardian on the above five typical tasks.

To solve this problem, Multi-modal Multi-instance Multi-label (M3) learning provides a framework for handling such task and has exhibited excellent performance. Besides, how to effectively utilize label correlation is also a challenging issue.

Existing solutions either rely on a user reputation system or consist of a highly specialized predictor that is tailored to a specific peer-production system. In this work, we explore a different point in the solution space that goes beyond user reputation but does not involve any content-based feature of the edits. We view each edit as a game between the editor and the component of the project. We posit that the probability that an edit is accepted is a function of the editor's skill, of the difficulty of editing the component and of a user-component interaction term. Our model is broadly applicable, as it only requires observing data about who makes an edit, what the edit affects and whether the edit survives or not. We apply our model on Wikipedia and the Linux kernel, two examples of large-scale peer-production systems, and we seek to understand whether it can effectively predict edit survival: in both cases, we provide a positive answer. Our approach significantly outperforms those based solely on user reputation and bridges the gap with specialized predictors that use content-based features. It is simple to implement, computationally inexpensive, and in addition it enables us to discover interesting structure in the data."

Only more recent ones additionally use vertex and edge attributes to achieve a more accurate alignment. However, these methods are not designed to scale to map large graphs arising in many modern applications.

To this end, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical Spotlight Transcribing Network (STN) framework followed by a two-stage ""where-to-what'' solution. Specifically, we first decide ""where-to-look'' through a novel spotlight mechanism to focus on different areas of the original image following its structure. Then, we decide ""what-to-write'' by developing a GRU based network with the spotlight areas for transcribing the content accordingly. Moreover, we propose two implementations on the basis of STN, i.e., STNM and STNR, where the spotlight movement follows the Markov property and Recurrent modeling, respectively.

Aggarwal, ","The problem of network representation learning, also known as network embedding, arises in many machine learning tasks assuming that there exist a small number of variabilities in the vertex representations which can capture the ""semantics"" of the original network structure. Most existing network embedding models, with shallow or deep architectures, learn vertex representations from the sampled vertex sequences such that the low-dimensional embeddings preserve the locality property and/or global reconstruction capability. The resultant representations, however, are difficult for model generalization due to the intrinsic sparsity of sampled sequences from the input network. As such, an ideal approach to address the problem is to generate vertex representations by learning a probability density function over the sampled sequences. However, in many cases, such a distribution in a low-dimensional manifold may not always have an analytic form. In this study, we propose to learn the network representations with adversarially regularized autoencoders (NetRA). NetRA learns smoothly regularized vertex representations that well capture the network structure through jointly considering both locality-preserving and global reconstruction constraints. The joint inference is encapsulated in a generative adversarial training process to circumvent the requirement of an explicit prior distribution, and thus obtains better generalization performance. We demonstrate empirically how well key properties of the network structure are captured and the effectiveness of NetRA on a variety of tasks, including network reconstruction, link prediction, and multi-label classification."

Aggarwal, Kai Zhang, ","Massive and dynamic networks arise in many practical applications such as social media, security and public health. Given an evolutionary network, it is crucial to detect structural anomalies, such as vertices and edges whose ""behaviors'' deviate from underlying majority of the network, in a real-time fashion. Recently, network embedding has proven a powerful tool in learning the low-dimensional representations of vertices in networks that can capture and preserve the network structure. However, most existing network embedding approaches are designed for static networks, and thus may not be perfectly suited for a dynamic environment in which the network representation has to be constantly updated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, NetWalk, for anomaly detection in dynamic networks by learning network representations which can be updated dynamically as the network evolves. We first encode the vertices of the dynamic network to vector representations by clique embedding, which jointly minimizes the pairwise distance of vertex representations of each walk derived from the dynamic networks, and the deep autoencoder reconstruction error serving as a global regularization. The vector representations can be computed with constant space requirements using reservoir sampling. On the basis of the learned low-dimensional vertex representations, a clustering-based technique is employed to incrementally and dynamically detect network anomalies. Compared with existing approaches, NetWalk has several advantages: 1) the network embedding can be updated dynamically, 2) streaming network nodes and edges can be encoded efficiently with constant memory space usage, 3). flexible to be applied on different types of networks, and 4) network anomalies can be detected in real-time. Extensive experiments on four real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NetWalk."

Faced with complex data distributions in the real world, can we fit and interpret them by a unified but parsimonious parametric model? In this paper, we view the complex empirical data as being generated by a dynamic system which takes uniform randomness as input. By modeling the generative dynamics of data, we showcase a four-parameter dynamic model together with inference and simulation algorithms, which is able to fit and generate a family of distributions, ranging from Gaussian, Exponential, Power Law, Stretched Exponential (Weibull), to their complex variants with multi-scale complexities. Rather than a black box, our model can be interpreted by a unified differential equation, which captures the underlying generative dynamics. More powerful models can be constructed by our framework in a principled way. We validate our model by various synthetic datasets. We then apply our model to $16$ real-world datasets from different disciplines. We show the systematic biases of fitting these datasets by the most widely used methods and show the superiority of our model.

However, expanding the scale of high-quality yet structured medical knowledge usually comes with tedious efforts in data preparation and human annotation. To promote the benefits while minimizing the data requirement in expanding medical knowledge, we introduce a generative perspective to study the relational medical entity pair discovery problem. A generative model named Conditional Relationship Variational Autoencoder is proposed to discover meaningful and novel medical entity pairs by purely learning from the expression diversity in the existing relational medical entity pairs. Unlike discriminative approaches where high-quality contexts and candidate medical entity pairs are carefully prepared to be examined by the model, the proposed model generates novel entity pairs directly by sampling from a learned latent space without further data requirement. The proposed model explores the generative modeling capacity for medical entity pairs while incorporating deep learning for hands-free feature engineering. It is not only able to generate meaningful medical entity pairs that are not yet observed, but also can generate entity pairs for a specific medical relationship. The proposed model adjusts the initial representations of medical entities by addressing their relational commonalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on real-world relational medical entity pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating relational medical entity pairs that are meaningful and novel."

However, most existing truth discovery methods are designed for structured data, and cannot meet the strong need to extract trustworthy information from raw text data as text data has its unique characteristics. The major challenges of inferring true information on text data stem from the multifactorial property of text answers (i.e., an answer may contain multiple key factors) and the diversity of word usages (i.e., different words may have the same semantic meaning). To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel truth discovery method, named ""TextTruth"", which jointly groups the keywords extracted from the answers of a specific question into multiple interpretable factors, and infers the trustworthiness of both answer factors and answer providers. After that, the answers to each question can be ranked based on the estimated trustworthiness of factors.

In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic method, which includes a multi-class multi-label dependency (MCMLD) model, to address this problem. The proposed method assumes that the label-correlation exists in both unknown true labels and noisy crowdsourced labels. Thus, it introduces a mixture of multiple independently multinoulli distributions to capture the correlation among the labels. Finally, the unknown true values of the multiple labels of each task, together with a set of confusion matrices modeling the reliability of the workers, can be jointly inferred through an EM algorithm. Experiments with three simulated typical crowdsourcing scenarios and a real-world dataset consistently show that our proposed MCMLD method significantly outperforms several competitive alternatives. Furthermore, if the labels are strongly correlated, the advantage of MCMLD will be more remarkable."

One core challenge is to identify and reduce the overlap of the influence from different billboards to the same trajectories, while keeping the budget constraint into consideration. We show that this problem is NP-hard and present an enumeration based algorithm with $(1-1/e)$ approximation ratio. However, the enumeration should be very costly when $|\ur|$ is large. By exploiting the locality property of billboards' influence, we propose a partition-based framework \psel. \psel partitions $\ur$ into a set of small clusters, computes the locally influential billboards for each cluster, and merges them to generate the global solution. Since the local solutions can be obtained much more efficient than the global one, \psel should reduce the computation cost greatly; meanwhile it achieves a non-trivial approximation ratio guarantee. Then we propose a \bbsel method to further prune billboards with low marginal influence, while achieving the same approximation ratio as \psel. Experiments on real datasets verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods."

Tsang, Hongzhi Yin, ","The efficiency of top-k recommendation is vital to large-scale recommender systems. Hashing is not only an efficient alternative but also complementary to distributed computing, and also a practical and effective option in a computing environment with limited resources. Hashing techniques improve the efficiency of online recommendation by representing users and items by binary codes. However, objective functions of existing methods are not consistent with ultimate goals of recommender systems, and are often optimized via discrete coordinate descent, easily getting stuck in a local optimum. To this end, we propose a Discrete Ranking-based Matrix Factorization (DRMF) algorithm based on each user's pairwise preferences, and formulate it into binary quadratic programming problems to learn binary codes. Due to non-convexity and binary constraints, we further propose self-paced learning for improving the optimization, to include pairwise preferences gradually from easy to complex. We finally evaluate the proposed algorithm on three public real-world datasets, and show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing-based recommendation algorithms, and even achieves comparable performance to matrix factorization methods."

OAL can solve many real-world problems, such as anomaly detection in healthcare, finance and network security. In these problems, there are two key challenges: the query budget is often limited; the ratio between two classes is highly imbalanced. To address these challenges, existing work of OAL adopts either asymmetric losses or queries (an isolated asymmetric strategy) to tackle the imbalance, and uses first-order methods to optimize the cost-sensitive measure. However, they may incur two deficiencies: (1) the poor ability in handling imbalanced data due to the isolated asymmetric strategy; (2) relative slow convergence rate due to the first-order optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel Online Adaptive Asymmetric Active (OA3) learning algorithm, which is based on a new asymmetric strategy (merging both the asymmetric losses and queries strategies), and second-order optimization. We theoretically analyze its bounds, and also empirically evaluate it on four real-world online anomaly detection tasks. Promising results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in various application domains."

The existing methods show that the high-order proximity plays a key role in capturing the underlying structure of the network. However, two fundamental problems in preserving the high-order proximity remain unsolved. First, all the existing methods can only preserve fixed-order proximities, despite that proximities of different orders are often desired for distinct networks and target applications. Second, given a certain order proximity, the existing methods cannot guarantee accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose AROPE (arbitrary-order proximity preserved embedding), a novel network embedding method based on SVD framework. We theoretically prove the eigen-decomposition reweighting theorem, revealing the intrinsic relationship between proximities of different orders. With this theorem, we propose a scalable eigen-decomposition solution to derive the embedding vectors and shift them between proximities of arbitrary orders. Theoretical analysis is provided to guarantee that i) our method has a low marginal cost in shifting the embedding vectors across different orders, ii) given a certain order, our method can get the global optimal solutions, and iii) the overall time complexity of our method is linear with respect to network size. Extensive experimental results on several large-scale networks demonstrate that our proposed method greatly and consistently outperforms the baselines in various tasks including network reconstruction, link prediction and node classification."

A specific computational resource in this regard is the time needed for evaluating predictions on test instances. There is meanwhile a substantial body of work concerned with the joint optimization of accuracy and test-time efficiency by considering the time costs of feature generation and model prediction. During the feature generation process, significant redundant computations across different features occur in many applications. Although the elimination of such redundancies would reduce the time cost substantially, there has been little research in this area due to substantial technical challenges involved, especially: 1) the lack of an effective formulation for feature computation dependency; and 2) the nonconvex and discrete nature of the optimization over feature computation dependency. In order to address these problems, this paper first proposes a heterogeneous hypergraph to represent the feature computation dependency, after which a framework is proposed that jointly optimizes the accuracy and the exact test-time cost based on a given feature computational dependency. A continuous tight approximation to this original problem is proposed based on a non-monotone nonconvex regularization term. Finally, an effective nonconvex optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, along with a theoretical analysis of the convergence conditions. Extensive experiments on eight synthetic datasets and six real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed models' outstanding performance in terms of both accuracy and prediction-time cost."

To relieve this problem, in this paper we propose a novel framework for compressing trajectory data, REST (Reference-based Spatio-temporal trajectory compression), by which a raw trajectory is represented by concatenation of a series of historical (sub-)trajectories (called reference trajectories) that form the compressed trajectory within a given spatio-temporal deviation threshold. In order to construct a reference trajectory set that can most benefit the subsequent compression, we propose three kinds of techniques to select reference trajectories wisely from a large dataset such that the resulting reference set is more compact yet covering most footprints of trajectories in the area of interest. To address the computational issue caused by the large number of combinations of reference trajectories that may exist for resembling a given trajectory, we propose efficient greedy algorithms that run in the blink of an eye and dynamic programming algorithms that can achieve the optimal compression ratio. Compared to existing work on trajectory compression, our framework has few assumptions about data such as moving within a road network or moving with constant direction and speed, and better compression performance with fairly small spatio-temporal loss. Extensive experiments on a real taxi trajectory dataset demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing representative approaches in terms of both compression ratio and efficiency."

As a result, rare category characterization becomes a fundamental learning task, which aims to accurately characterize the rare categories given limited label information. The unique challenge of rare category characterization, i.e., the non-separability nature of the rare categories from the majority classes, together with the availability of the multi-modal representation of the examples, poses a new research question: how can we learn a salient rare category oriented embedding representation such that the rare examples are well separated from the majority class examples in the embedding space, which facilitates the follow-up rare category characterization?"

However, most existing works in crowdsourcing mainly focus on label inference and incentive design. In this paper, we address a different problem of adaptive crowd teaching, which is a sub-area of machine teaching in the context of crowdsourcing. Compared with machines, human beings are extremely good at learning a specific target concept (e.g., classifying the images into given categories) and they can also easily transfer the learned concepts into similar learning tasks. Therefore, a more effective way of utilizing crowdsourcing is by supervising the crowd to label in the form of teaching. In order to perform the teaching and expertise estimation simultaneously, we propose an adaptive teaching framework named JEDI to construct the personalized optimal teaching set for the crowdsourcing workers. In JEDI teaching, the teacher assumes that each learner has an exponentially decayed memory. Furthermore, it ensures comprehensiveness in the learning process by carefully balancing teaching diversity and learner's accurate learning in terms of teaching usefulness. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and efficacy of JEDI teaching in comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques on multiple data sets with both synthetic learners and real crowdsourcing workers."

Most of the existing embedding methods embed nodes as point vectors in a low-dimensional continuous space. In this way, the formation of the edge is deterministic and only determined by the positions of the nodes. However, the formation and evolution of real-world networks are full of uncertainties, which makes these methods not optimal. To address the problem, we propose a novel Deep Variational Network Embedding in Wasserstein Space (DVNE) in this paper. The proposed method learns a Gaussian distribution in the Wasserstein space as the latent representation of each node, which can simultaneously preserve the network structure and model the uncertainty of nodes. Specifically, we use 2-Wasserstein distance as the similarity measure between the distributions, which can well preserve the transitivity in the network with a linear computational cost. Moreover, our method implies the mathematical relevance of mean and variance by the deep variational model, which can well capture the position of the node by the mean vectors and the uncertainties of nodes by the variance. Additionally, our method captures both the local and global network structure by preserving the first-order and second-order proximity in the network. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively model the uncertainty of nodes in networks, and show a substantial gain on real-world applications such as link prediction and multi-label classification compared with the state-of-the-art methods."

Besides, many critical factors related to the quality of a song such as chord progression and rhythm patterns are not well addressed. In particular, the problem of how to ensure the harmony of multi-track music is still underexplored. To this end, we present a focused study on pop music generation, in which we take both chord and rhythm influence of melody generation and the harmony of music arrangement into consideration. We propose an end-to-end melody and arrangement generation framework, called XiaoIce Band, which generates a melody track with several accompany tracks played by several types of instruments. Specifically, we devise a Chord based Rhythm and Melody Cross-Generation Model (CRMCG) to generate melody with chord progressions. Then, we propose a Multi-Instrument Co-Arrangement Model (MICA) using multi-task learning for multi-track music arrangement. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset, where the results demonstrate the effectiveness of XiaoIce Band."

Despite their proliferation, currently there is no study of their robustness to adversarial attacks. Yet, in domains where they are likely to be used, e.g. the web, adversaries are common. Can deep learning models for graphs be easily fooled? In this work, we introduce the first study of adversarial attacks on attributed graphs, specifically focusing on models exploiting ideas of graph convolutions. In addition to attacks at test time, we tackle the more challenging class of poisoning/causative attacks, which focus on the training phase of a machine learning model.We generate adversarial perturbations targeting the node's features and the graph structure, thus, taking the dependencies between instances in account. Moreover, we ensure that the perturbations remain unnoticeable by preserving important data characteristics. To cope with the underlying discrete domain we propose an efficient algorithm Nettack exploiting incremental computations. Our experimental study shows that accuracy of node classification significantly drops even when performing only few perturbations. Even more, our attacks are transferable: the learned attacks generalize to other state-of-the-art node classification models and unsupervised approaches, and likewise are successful even when only limited knowledge about the graph is given."

Nevertheless, the complete temporal formation process of networks characterized by sequential interactive events between nodes has yet seldom been modeled in the existing studies, which calls for further research on the so-called temporal network embedding problem. In light of this, in this paper, we introduce the concept of neighborhood formation sequence to describe the evolution of a node, where temporal excitation effects exist between neighbors in the sequence, and thus we propose a Hawkes process based Temporal Network Embedding (HTNE) method. HTNE well integrates the Hawkes process into network embedding so as to capture the influence of historical neighbors on the current neighbors. In particular, the interactions of low-dimensional vectors are fed into the Hawkes process as base rate and temporal influence, respectively. In addition, attention mechanism is also integrated into HTNE to better determine the influence of historical neighbors on current neighbors of a node. Experiments on three large-scale real-life networks demonstrate that the embeddings learned from the proposed HTNE model achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods in various tasks including node classification, link prediction, and embedding visualization. In particular, temporal recommendation based on arrival rate inferred from node embeddings shows excellent predictive power of the proposed model."

These factors, combined with the ease of deployment compared to traditional software, have led to deep learning models replacing production software stacks in not only traditional machine learning-driven products including translation and search, but also in many previously heuristic-based applications. This new mode of software construction and deployment has been called Software 2.0 [2]. A key bottleneck in the construction of Software 2.0 applications is the need for large, high-quality training sets for each task. This talk describes Snorkel, a system that enables users to help shape, create, and manage training data for Software 2.0 stacks. In Snorkel applications, instead of tediously hand-labeling individual data items, a user implicitly defines large training sets by writing programs, called labeling functions, that assign labels to subsets of data points, albeit noisily. This idea of using multiple, imperfect sources of labels builds on work in distant supervision. However, if ignored, the uneven (and unknown) accuracies and coverages of the user-provided labeling functions can easily lead to suboptimal results: Example. Suppose we have two training sets, T1 and T2, which are produced by two processes (or labeling functions). T1 has high accuracy say 90% but low yield, labeling 10k points while T2 has lower accuracy, 60%, but higher yield, 1M points. If we put the training sets together, we have a set T of 1.01M points with overall accuracy 60.3%. This could be distressing for a user: a model trained on T1 seems to lose quality when trained on all of T. Naively combining the training sets fails to account for the different origins of T1 and T2. Snorkel addresses this challenge of uneven training source quality by automatically learning a statistical model of the labeling functions' accuracies and correlation structure. The lack of hand-labeled data when learning this model raises several statistical challenges including estimating accuracies, learning correlations, and selecting features that refine labeling function quality [1,3,4]. Snorkel then uses this model to combine and reweight the labeling functions' labels, producing a set of probabilistic training labels, thus effectively passing along key provenance information about the training. Our experimental results and theory show that estimating and accounting for the quality of the labeling functions in this way can lead to improved training set labels and boost downstream application quality-potentially by large margins, e.g., more than ten points of F1 score in NLP applications. Exploiting the varied quality of supervision is a key building block to help manage the software 2.0 stack-but it's far from the only technique. Indeed, recent extensions of these core themes have led to projects automatically generating data augmentations, synthesizing labeling functions, and programmatically defining multi-task supervision. This does not even touch the many new opportunities for deployment and systems in Software 2.0. Hence, we contend there is a broad research motivated by Software 2.0. Although only two years old, the Snorkel project powers applications in major tech companies and scientific efforts. It is used in applications in traditional machine learning applications like natural language processing, medical imaging, and prediction. Perhaps more excitingly for the Software 2.0 vision, it's also used in traditional enterprise applications like data cleaning, data integration, and semi-structured extraction- areas that have traditionally been difficult to deploy machine learning for. For more information about the formal underpinnings and applications of Snorkel, we refer to Snorkel.stanford.edu for open source code, tutorial, and links to technical papers."

I show how one can explore the underlying statistical and algorithmic characteristics unique to ML programs but not typical in traditional computer programs in designing the system architecture to achieve significant, universal, and theoretically sound power-up of ML program across the board. I also present a briefly introduction of the Petuum system based on such interdisciplinary innovations, which intends to dramatically improve adoption of AI solutions by lowering the barrier of entry to AI technologies via Automatic Machine Learning through Petuum. I show how, through automatable, product-grade, hardware-agnostic, standardized building blocks that can be assembled and customized, AI users can liberate themselves from the demanding experience of algorithm programming and system tuning, and easily experiment with different AI methods, parameters, and speed/resource trade-offs by themselves or automatically. To put this in a broader context, recent discussions about AI in both research community, and the general public have been championing a novelistic view of AI, that AI can mimic, surpass, threaten, or even destroy mankind. And such discussions are fueled by mainly recent advances in deep learning experimentations and applications, which are however often plagued by its craftiness, un-interpretability, and poor generalizability. I will discuss a different view of AI as a rigorous engineering discipline and as a commodity, where standardization, modularity, repeatability, reusability, and transparency are commonly expected, just as in civil engineering where builders apply principles and techniques from all sciences to build reliable constructions. I will discuss how such a view sets different focus, approach, metric, and expectation for AI research and engineering, which we practiced in our SysML work."
