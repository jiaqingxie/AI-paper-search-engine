www,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1963405.1963409,"Games, algorithms, and the Internet","Christos H. Papadimitriou, ","The advent of the Internet brought parallel paradigm shifts to both Economics and Computer Science. Computer scientists realized that large-scale performing systems can emerge from the interaction of selfish agents and that incentives are a quintessential part of a good system design. And economists saw that the default platforms of economic transactions are computational and interconnected. Algorithmic Game Theory is a subdiscipline that emerged from this turmoil, revisiting some of the most important problems in Economics and Game Theory from a computational and network perspective. This talk will survey some of the major themes, results and challenges in this field."

However, due to the huge number of user behavior variables and coarse level intent labels defined by human editors, it is very difficult to directly model user behavioral dynamics or user intent dynamics in user search sessions. In this paper, we propose a novel Sparse Hidden-Dynamic Conditional Random Fields (SHDCRF) model for user intent learning from their search sessions. Through incorporating the proposed hidden state variables, SHDCRF aims to learn a substructure, i.e. a set of related hidden variables, for each intent label and they are used to model the intermediate dynamics between user intent labels and user behavioral variables. In addition, SHDCRF learns a sparse relation between the hidden variables and intent labels to make the hidden state variables explainable. Extensive experiment results, on real user search sessions from a popular commercial search engine show that the proposed SHDCRF model significantly outperforms in terms of intent prediction results that those classical solutions such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Latnet-Dynamic Conditional Random Field (LDCRF)."

Recent advances in click models have adopted the examination hypothesis which distinguishes document relevance from position bias. In this paper, we revisit the examination hypothesis and observe that user clicks cannot be completely explained by relevance and position bias. Specifically, users with different search intents may submit the same query to the search engine but expect different search results. Thus, there might be a bias between user search intent and the query formulated by the user, which can lead to the diversity in user clicks. This bias has not been considered in previous works such as UBM, DBN and CCM. In this paper, we propose a new intent hypothesis as a complement to the examination hypothesis. This hypothesis is used to characterize the bias between the user search intent and the query in each search session. This hypothesis is very general and can be applied to most of the existing click models to improve their capacities in learning unbiased relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that after adopting the intent hypothesis, click models can better interpret user clicks and achieve a significant NDCG improvement."

Chilton, Jaime Teevan, ","Web search engines have historically focused on connecting people with information resources. For example, if a person wanted to know when their flight to Hyderabad was leaving, a search engine might connect them with the airline where they could find flight status information. However, search engines have recently begun to try to meet people's search needs directly, providing, for example, flight status information in response to queries that include an airline and a flight number. In this paper, we use large scale query log analysis to explore the challenges a search engine faces when trying to meet an information need directly in the search result page. We look at how people's interaction behavior changes when inline content is returned, finding that such content can cannibalize clicks from the algorithmic results. We see that in the absence of interaction behavior, an individual's repeat search behavior can be useful in understanding the content's value. We also discuss some of the ways user behavior can be used to provide insight into when inline answers might better trigger and what types of additional information might be included in the results."

Traditional approaches mainly focused on recommending alternative queries with close search intent to the original query. However, to only take relevance into account may generate redundant recommendations to users. It is better to provide diverse as well as relevant query recommendations, so that we can cover multiple potential search intents of users and minimize the risk that users will not be satisfied. Besides, previous query recommendation approaches mostly relied on measuring the relevance or similarity between queries in the Euclidean space. However, there is no convincing evidence that the query space is Euclidean. It is more natural and reasonable to assume that the query space is a manifold. In this paper, therefore, we aim to recommend diverse and relevant queries based on the intrinsic query manifold. We propose a unified model, named manifold ranking with stop points, for query recommendation. By turning ranked queries into stop points on the query manifold, our approach can generate query recommendations by simultaneously considering both diversity and relevance in a unified way. Empirical experimental results on a large scale query log of a commercial search engine show that our approach can effectively generate highly diverse as well as closely related query recommendations."
www,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1963405.1963416,Improving recommendation for long-tail queries via templates,"Idan Szpektor, Aristides Gionis, Yoelle Maarek, ","The ability to aggregate huge volumes of queries over a large population of users allows search engines to build precise models for a variety of query-assistance features such as query recommendation, correction, etc. Yet, no matter how much data is aggregated, the long-tail distribution implies that a large fraction of queries are rare. As a result, most query assistance services perform poorly or are not even triggered on long-tail queries. We propose a method to extend the reach of query assistance techniques (and in particular query recommendation) to long-tail queries by reasoning about rules between query templates rather than individual query transitions, as currently done in query-flow graph models. As a simple example, if we recognize that 'Montezuma' is a city in the rare query ""Montezuma surf"" and if the rule 'city surf → beach has been observed, we are able to offer ""Montezuma beach"" as a recommendation, even if the two queries were never observed in a same session. We conducted experiments to validate our hypothesis, first via traditional small-scale editorial assessments but more interestingly via a novel automated large scale evaluation methodology. Our experiments show that general coverage can be relatively increased by 24% using templates without penalizing quality. Furthermore, for 36% of the 95M queries in our query flow graph, which have no out edges and thus could not be served recommendations, we can now offer at least one recommendation in 98% of the cases."

While existing Web services such as Yahoo! and Digg attract users' initial clicks by leveraging various kinds of signals, how to engage such users algorithmically after their initial visit is largely under-explored. In this paper, we study the problem of post-click news recommendation. Given that a user has perused a current news article, our idea is to automatically identify ""related"" news articles which the user would like to read afterwards. Specifically, we propose to characterize relatedness between news articles across four aspects: relevance, novelty, connection clarity, and transition smoothness. Motivated by this understanding, we define a set of features to capture each of these aspects and put forward a learning approach to model relatedness. In order to quantitatively evaluate our proposed measures and learn a unified relatedness function, we construct a large test collection based on a four-month commercial news corpus with editorial judgments. The experimental results show that the proposed heuristics can indeed capture relatedness, and that the learned unified relatedness function works quite effectively."

The search engine aggregates the results and produces one ranked list, constraining the vertical results to specific slots on the SERP."

In this paper we tackle two new scenarios for link suggestion, which were not covered in prior work owing to scarcity of historical browsing data. In the web search scenario, we propose a method for generating quick links - additional entry points into Web sites, which are shown for top search results for navigational queries - for tail sites, for which little browsing statistics is available. Beyond Web search, we also propose a method for link suggestion in general web browsing, effectively anticipating the next link to be followed by the user. Our approach performs clustering of Web sites in order to aggregate information across multiple sites, and enables relevant link suggestion for virtually any site, including tail sites and brand new sites for which little historical data is available. Empirical evaluation confirms the validity of our method using editorially labeled data as well as real-life search and browsing data from a major US search engine."
www,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1963405.1963421,A self-training approach for resolving object coreference on the semantic web,"Wei Hu, Jianfeng Chen, Yuzhong Qu, ","An object on the Semantic Web is likely to be denoted with multiple URIs by different parties. Object coreference resolution is to identify ""equivalent"" URIs that denote the same object. Driven by the Linking Open Data (LOD) initiative, millions of URIs have been explicitly linked with owl:sameAs statements, but potentially coreferent ones are still considerable. Existing approaches address the problem mainly from two directions: one is based upon equivalence inference mandated by OWL semantics, which finds semantically coreferent URIs but probably omits many potential ones; the other is via similarity computation between property-value pairs, which is not always accurate enough. In this paper, we propose a self-training approach for object coreference resolution on the Semantic Web, which leverages the two classes of approaches to bridge the gap between semantically coreferent URIs and potential candidates. For an object URI, we firstly establish a kernel that consists of semantically coreferent URIs based on owl:sameAs, (inverse) functional properties and (max-)cardinalities, and then extend such kernel iteratively in terms of discriminative property-value pairs in the descriptions of URIs. In particular, the discriminability is learnt with a statistical measurement, which not only exploits key characteristics for representing an object, but also takes into account the matchability between properties from pragmatics. In addition, frequent property combinations are mined to improve the accuracy of the resolution. We implement a scalable system and demonstrate that our approach achieves good precision and recall for resolving object coreference, on both benchmark and large-scale datasets."

Previous approaches to the problem achieve reasonable segmentation performance but are tested only against a small corpus of manually segmented queries. In addition, many of the previous approaches are fairly intricate as they use expensive features and are difficult to be reimplemented."

In this paper we show that context, such as the user's recent queries, can be used to improve the prediction quality considerably even for such short prefixes. We propose a context-sensitive query auto completion algorithm, NearestCompletion, which outputs the completions of the user's input that are most similar to the context queries. To measure similarity, we represent queries and contexts as high-dimensional term-weighted vectors and resort to cosine similarity. The mapping from queries to vectors is done through a new query expansion technique that we introduce, which expands a query by traversing the query recommendation tree rooted at the query."

Misspelling is a common phenomenon among search engines queries. In order to help users effectively express their information needs, mechanisms for automatically correcting misspelled queries are required. Online spelling correction aims to provide spell corrected completion suggestions as a query is incrementally entered. As latency is crucial to the utility of the suggestions, such an algorithm needs to be not only accurate, but also efficient."
www,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1963405.1963427,An expressive mechanism for auctions on the web,"Paul Dütting, Monika Henzinger, Ingmar Weber, ","Auctions are widely used on the Web. Applications range from internet advertising to platforms such as eBay. In most of these applications the auctions in use are single/multi-item auctions with unit demand. The main drawback of standard mechanisms for this type of auctions, such as VCG and GSP, is the limited expressiveness that they offer to the bidders. The General Auction Mechanism (GAM) of [1] is taking a first step towards addressing the problem of limited expressiveness by computing a bidder optimal, envy free outcome for linear utility functions with identical slopes and a single discontinuity per bidder-item pair. We show that in many practical situations this does not suffice to adequately model the preferences of the bidders, and we overcome this problem by presenting the first mechanism for piece-wise linear utility functions with non-identical slopes and multiple discontinuities. Our mechanism runs in polynomial time. Like GAM it is incentive compatible for inputs that fulfill a certain non-degeneracy requirement, but our requirement is more general than the requirement of GAM. For discontinuous utility functions that are non-degenerate as well as for continuous utility functions the outcome of our mechanism is a competitive equilibrium. We also show how our mechanism can be used to compute approximately bidder optimal, envy free outcomes for a general class of continuous utility functions via piece-wise linear approximation. Finally, we prove hardness results for even more expressive settings."

We provide a game-theoretic model within which to study the problem of incentivizing high quality UGC, in which contributors are strategic and motivated by exposure. Our model has the feature that both the quality of contributions as well as the extent of participation is determined endogenously in a free-entry Nash equilibrium."

Mobius, Hamid Nazerzadeh, ","We present a simple auction mechanism which extends the second-price auction with reserve and is truthful in expectation. This mechanism is particularly effective in private value environments where the distribution of valuations are irregular. Bidders can ""buy-it-now"", or alternatively ""take-a-chance"" where the top d bidders are equally likely to win. The randomized take-a-chance allocation incentivizes high valuation bidders to buy-it-now. We show that for a large class of valuations, this mechanism achieves similar allocations and revenues as Myerson's optimal mechanism, and outperforms the second-price auction with reserve."
www,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1963405.1963431,"Here, there, and everywhere: correlated online behaviors can lead to overestimates of the effects of advertising","Randall A. Lewis, Justin M. Rao, David H. Reiley, ","Measuring the causal effects of online advertising (adfx) on user behavior is important to the health of the WWW publishing industry. In this paper, using three controlled experiments, we show that observational data frequently lead to incorrect estimates of adfx. The reason, which we label ""activity bias,"" comes from the surprising amount of time-based correlation between the myriad activities that users undertake online. In Experiment 1, users who are exposed to an ad on a given day are much more likely to engage in brand-relevant search queries as compared to their recent history for reasons that had nothing do with the advertisement. In Experiment 2, we show that activity bias occurs for page views across diverse websites. In Experiment 3, we track account sign-ups at a competitor's (of the advertiser) website and find that many more people sign-up on the day they saw an advertisement than on other days, but that the true ""competitive effect"" was minimal. In all three experiments, exposure to a campaign signals doing ""more of everything"" in given period of time, making it difficult to find a suitable ""matched control"" using prior behavior. In such cases, the ""match"" is fundamentally different from the exposed group, and we show how and why observational methods lead to a massive overestimate of adfx in such circumstances."

A novel variant of this problem, where items are worthless unless collected in bundles, is introduced here. This setup is similar to the Groupon model, where a deal is off unless a minimum number of users sign up for it. Since the optimal algorithm to solve this problem is not practical, several adaptive greedy approaches with reasonable time and memory requirements are studied in detail - theoretically, as well as, experimentally. Worst case performance guarantees are provided for some of these greedy algorithms, while results of experimental evaluation demonstrate that they are much closer to optimal than what the theoretical bounds suggest. Applications include optimizing for online advertising pricing models where advertisers pay only when certain goals, in terms of clicks or conversions, are met. We perform extensive experiments for the situation where there are between two and five ads. For typical ad conversion rates, the greedy policy of selecting items having the highest individual expected reward obtains a value within 5% of optimal over 95% of the time for a wide selection of parameters."

As cloud-based services are more numerous and dynamic, the development of efficient service provisioning policies become increasingly challenging. Game theoretic approaches have shown to gain a thorough analytical understanding of the service provisioning problem."

Stokes, Wenke Lee, ","A drive-by download attack occurs when a user visits a webpage which attempts to automatically download malware without the user's consent. Attackers sometimes use a malware distribution network (MDN) to manage a large number of malicious webpages, exploits, and malware executables. In this paper, we provide a new method to determine these MDNs from the secondary URLs and redirect chains recorded by a high-interaction client honeypot. In addition, we propose a novel drive-by download detection method. Instead of depending on the malicious content used by previous methods, our algorithm first identifies and then leverages the URLs of the MDN's central servers, where a central server is a common server shared by a large percentage of the drive-by download attacks in the same MDN. A set of regular expression-based signatures are then generated based on the URLs of each central server. This method allows additional malicious webpages to be identified which launched but failed to execute a successful drive-by download attack. The new drive-by detection system named ARROW has been implemented, and we provide a large-scale evaluation on the output of a production drive-by detection system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where the detection coverage has been boosted by 96% with an extremely low false positive rate."

In a drive-by-download exploit, an attacker embeds a malicious script (typically written in JavaScript) into a web page. When a victim visits this page, the script is executed and attempts to compromise the browser or one of its plugins. To detect drive-by-download exploits, researchers have developed a number of systems that analyze web pages for the presence of malicious code. Most of these systems use dynamic analysis. That is, they run the scripts associated with a web page either directly in a real browser (running in a virtualized environment) or in an emulated browser, and they monitor the scripts' executions for malicious activity. While the tools are quite precise, the analysis process is costly, often requiring in the order of tens of seconds for a single page. Therefore, performing this analysis on a large set of web pages containing hundreds of millions of samples can be prohibitive."

John, Fang Yu, Yinglian Xie, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Martín Abadi, ","Many malicious activities on the Web today make use of compromised Web servers, because these servers often have high pageranks and provide free resources. Attackers are therefore constantly searching for vulnerable servers. In this work, we aim to understand how attackers find, compromise, and misuse vulnerable servers. Specifically, we present heat-seeking honeypots that actively attract attackers, dynamically generate and deploy honeypot pages, then analyze logs to identify attack patterns."

Unfortunately such information is not always trustworthy, as different sources are of very different qualities and often provide inaccurate and conflicting information. Existing approaches attack this problem using unsupervised learning methods, and try to infer the confidence of the data value and trustworthiness of each source from each other by assuming values provided by more sources are more accurate. However, because false values can be widespread through copying among different sources and out-of-date data often overwhelm up-to-date data, such bootstrapping methods are often ineffective."

The existing database selection methods (both text and relational) assess the source quality based on the query-similarity-based relevance assessment. When applied to the deep web these methods have two deficiencies. First is that the methods are agnostic to the correctness (trustworthiness) of the sources. Secondly, the query based relevance does not consider the importance of the results. These two considerations are essential for the open collections like the deep web. Since a number of sources provide answers to any query, we conjuncture that the agreements between these answers are likely to be helpful in assessing the importance and the trustworthiness of the sources. We compute the agreement between the sources as the agreement of the answers returned. While computing the agreement, we also measure and compensate for possible collusion between the sources. This adjusted agreement is modeled as a graph with sources at the vertices. On this agreement graph, a quality score of a source that we call SourceRank, is calculated as the stationary visit probability of a random walk. We evaluate SourceRank in multiple domains, including sources in Google Base, with sizes up to 675 sources. We demonstrate that the SourceRank tracks source corruption. Further, our relevance evaluations show that SourceRank improves precision by 22-60% over the Google Base and the other baseline methods. SourceRank has been implemented in a system called Factal."

Welch, Junghoo Cho, Christopher Olston, ","Ambiguous queries constitute a significant fraction of search instances and pose real challenges to web search engines. With current approaches the top results for these queries tend to be homogeneous, making it difficult for users interested in less popular aspects to find relevant documents. While existing research in search diversification offers several solutions for introducing variety into the results, the majority of such work is predicated, implicitly or otherwise, on the assumption that a single relevant document will fulfill a user's information need, making them inadequate for many informational queries. In this paper we present a search-diversification algorithm particularly suitable for informational queries by explicitly modeling that the user may need more than one page to satisfy their need. This modeling enables our algorithm to make a well-informed tradeoff between a user's desire for multiple relevant documents, probabilistic information about an average user's interest in the subtopics of a multifaceted query, and uncertainty in classifying documents into those subtopics. We evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm against commercial search engine results and other modern ranking strategies, demonstrating notable improvement in multiple document scenarios."

GPS-associated documents become popular with the pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies. For example, in Flickr, the geo-tagged photos are associated with tags and GPS locations. In Twitter, the locations of the tweets can be identified by the GPS locations from smart phones. Many interesting concepts, including cultures, scenes, and product sales, correspond to specialized geographical distributions. In this paper, we are interested in two questions: (1) how to discover different topics of interests that are coherent in geographical regions? (2) how to compare several topics across different geographical locations? To answer these questions, this paper proposes and compares three ways of modeling geographical topics: location-driven model, text-driven model, and a novel joint model called LGTA (Latent Geographical Topic Analysis) that combines location and text. To make a fair comparison, we collect several representative datasets from Flickr website including Landscape, Activity, Manhattan, National park, Festival, Car, and Food. The results show that the first two methods work in some datasets but fail in others. LGTA works well in all these datasets at not only finding regions of interests but also providing effective comparisons of the topics across different locations. The results confirm our hypothesis that the geographical distributions can help modeling topics, while topics provide important cues to group different geographical regions."

Hopcroft, Carl Lagoze, ","In this paper we study how to discover the evolution of topics over time in a time-stamped document collection. Our approach is uniquely designed to capture the rich topology of topic evolution inherent in the corpus. Instead of characterizing the evolving topics at fixed time points, we conceptually define a topic as a quantized unit of evolutionary change in content and discover topics with the time of their appearance in the corpus. Discovered topics are then connected to form a topic evolution graph using a measure derived from the underlying document network. Our approach allows inhomogeneous distribution of topics over time and does not impose any topological restriction in topic evolution graphs. We evaluate our algorithm on the ACM corpus."

They require algorithms capable of dealing with dynamic data to cluster, interpret and to temporally aggregate news articles. These three tasks are often solved separately. In this paper we present a unified framework to group incoming news articles into temporary but tightly-focused storylines, to identify prevalent topics and key entities within these stories, and to reveal the temporal structure of stories as they evolve. We achieve this by building a hybrid clustering and topic model. To deal with the available wealth of data we build an efficient parallel inference algorithm by sequential Monte Carlo estimation. Time and memory costs are nearly constant in the length of the history, and the approach scales to hundreds of thousands of documents. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy on the publicly available TDT dataset and data of a major internet news site."

To this end, we address three limitations of existing search engines in this paper. First, there is no straight-forward, fully automated way of going from textual queries to visual features. Image search engines therefore primarily rely on static and textual features for ranking. Visual features are mainly used for secondary tasks such as finding similar images. Second, image rankers are trained on query-image pairs labeled with relevance judgments determined by human experts. Such labels are well known to be noisy due to various factors including ambiguous queries, unknown user intent and subjectivity in human judgments. This leads to learning a sub-optimal ranker. Finally, a static ranker is typically built to handle disparate user queries. The ranker is therefore unable to adapt its parameters to suit the query at hand which again leads to sub-optimal results. We demonstrate that all of these problems can be mitigated by employing a re-ranking algorithm that leverages aggregate user click data."

Unfortunately, many videos on the Web such as those from the popular video sharing site YouTube do not have useful textual information. The goal of this paper is to propose a transfer learning framework for video summarization: in the training process both the video features and textual features are exploited to train a summarization algorithm while for summarizing a new video only its video features are utilized. The basic idea is to explore the transferability between videos and their corresponding textual information. Based on the assumption that video features and textual features are highly correlated with each other, we can transfer textual information into knowledge on summarization using video information only. In particular, we formulate the video summarization problem as that of learning a mapping from a set of shots of a video to a subset of the shots using the general framework of SVM-based structured learning. Textual information is transferred by encoding them into a set of constraints used in the structured learning process which tend to provide a more detailed and accurate characterization of the different subsets of shots. Experimental results show significant performance improvement of our approach and demonstrate the utility of textual information for enhancing video summarization."

The problem of classification of image data is often much more challenging than text data because of the following two reasons: (a) Labeled text data is very widely available for classification purposes. On the other hand, this is often not the case for image data, in which a lot of images are available from many sources, but many of them are often not labeled. (b) The image features are not directly related to semantic concepts inherent in class labels. On the other hand, since text data tends to have natural semantic interpretability (because of their human origins), they are often more directly related to class labels. Therefore, the relationships between the images and text features also provide additional hints for the classification process in terms of the image feature transformations which provide the most effective results."

Karame, Aurélien Francillon, Srdjan Čapkun, ","Currently, several online businesses deem that advertising revenues alone are not sufficient to generate profits and are therefore set to charge for online content. In this paper, we explore a complement to the current advertisement model; more specifically, we propose a micropayment model for non-specialized commodity web-services based on microcomputations. In our model, a user that wishes to access online content offered by a website does not need to register or pay to access the website; instead, he will accept to run microcomputations on behalf of the website in exchange for access to the content. These microcomputations can, for example, support ongoing computing projects that have clear social benefits (e.g., projects relating to HIV, dengue, cancer, etc.) or can contribute towards commercial computing projects. We argue that this micropayment model is economically and technically viable and that it can be integrated in existing distributed computing frameworks (e.g., the BOINC platform). We implement a preliminary prototype of a system based on our model through which we evaluate its performance and usability. Finally, we analyze the security and privacy of our proposal and we show that it ensures payment for the content while preserving the privacy of users."

Such a set of products is known as the consideration set. In this study, we consider the problem of generating consideration set of products in commerce search so as to maximize user satisfaction. One of the key features of commerce search that we exploit in our study is the association of a set of important attributes with the products and a set of specified attributes with the user queries. Those important attributes not used in the query are treated as unspecified. The attribute space admits a natural definition of user satisfaction via user preferences on the attributes and their values, viz. require that the surfaced products be close to the specified attribute values in the query, and diverse with respect to the unspecified attributes. We model this as a general Max-Sum Dispersion problem wherein we are given a set of n nodes in a metric space and the objective is to select a subset of nodes with total cost at most a given budget, and maximize the sum of the pairwise distances between the selected nodes. In our setting, each node denotes a product, the cost of a node being inversely proportional to its relevance with respect to specified attributes. The distance between two nodes quantifies the diversity with respect to the unspecified attributes. The problem is NP-hard and a 2-approximation was previously known only when all the nodes have unit cost."

Previous approaches to computing semantic relatedness mostly used static language resources, while essentially ignoring their temporal aspects. We believe that a considerable amount of relatedness information can also be found in studying patterns of word usage over time. Consider, for instance, a newspaper archive spanning many years. Two words such as ""war"" and ""peace"" might rarely co-occur in the same articles, yet their patterns of use over time might be similar. In this paper, we propose a new semantic relatedness model, Temporal Semantic Analysis (TSA), which captures this temporal information. The previous state of the art method, Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), represented word semantics as a vector of concepts. TSA uses a more refined representation, where each concept is no longer scalar, but is instead represented as time series over a corpus of temporally-ordered documents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate temporal evidence into models of semantic relatedness. Empirical evaluation shows that TSA provides consistent improvements over the state of the art ESA results on multiple benchmarks."

In most sentiment analysis applications, the sentiment lexicon plays a central role. However, it is well known that there is no universally optimal sentiment lexicon since the polarity of words is sensitive to the topic domain. Even worse, in the same domain the same word may indicate different polarities with respect to different aspects. For example, in a laptop review, ""large"" is negative for the battery aspect while being positive for the screen aspect. In this paper, we focus on the problem of learning a sentiment lexicon that is not only domain specific but also dependent on the aspect in context given an unlabeled opinionated text collection. We propose a novel optimization framework that provides a unified and principled way to combine different sources of information for learning such a context-dependent sentiment lexicon. Experiments on two data sets (hotel reviews and customer feedback surveys on printers) show that our approach can not only identify new sentiment words specific to the given domain but also determine the different polarities of a word depending on the aspect in context. In further quantitative evaluation, our method is proved to be effective in constructing a high quality lexicon by comparing with a human annotated gold standard. In addition, using the learned context-dependent sentiment lexicon improved the accuracy in an aspect-level sentiment classification task."

We first show that the state-of-the-art word breaking techniques can be unified and generalized under the Bayesian minimum risk (BMR) framework that, using a Web scale N-gram, can meet the first three requirements. We discuss how the existing techniques can be viewed as introducing additional assumptions to the basic BMR framework, and describe a generic yet efficient implementation called word synchronous beam search. Testing the framework and its implementation on a series of large scale experiments reveals the following. First, the language style used to build the model plays a critical role in the word breaking task, and the most suitable for the URL word breaking task appears to be that of the document title where the best performance is obtained. Models created from other language styles, such as from document body, anchor text, and even queries, exhibit varying degrees of mismatch. Although all styles benefit from increasing modeling power which, in our experiments, corresponds to the use of a higher order N-gram, the gain is most recognizable for the title model. The heuristics proposed by the prior arts do contribute to the word breaking performance for mismatched or less powerful models, but are less effective and, in many cases, lead to poorer performance than the matched model with minimal assumptions. For the matched model based on document titles, an accuracy rate of 97.18% can already be achieved using simple trigram without any heuristics."

Burges, ","We investigate the problem of learning to rank with document retrieval from the perspective of learning for multiple objective functions. We present solutions to two open problems in learning to rank: first, we show how multiple measures can be combined into a single graded measure that can be learned. This solves the problem of learning from a 'scorecard' of measures by making such scorecards comparable, and we show results where a standard web relevance measure (NDCG) is used for the top-tier measure, and a relevance measure derived from click data is used for the second-tier measure; the second-tier measure is shown to significantly improve while leaving the top-tier measure largely unchanged. Second, we note that the learning-to-rank problem can itself be viewed as changing as the ranking model learns: for example, early in learning, adjusting the rank of all documents can be advantageous, but later during training, it becomes more desirable to concentrate on correcting the top few documents for each query. We show how an analysis of these problems leads to an improved, iteration-dependent cost function that interpolates between a cost function that is more appropriate for early learning, with one that is more appropriate for late-stage learning. The approach results in a significant improvement in accuracy with the same size models. We investigate these ideas using LambdaMART, a state-of-the-art ranking algorithm."

We propose a framework where the ranking model is both optimized and evaluated using the same information retrieval measures such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Mean Average Precision (MAP). The main difficulty in direct optimization of NDCG and MAP is that these measures depend on the rank of objects and are not differentiable. Most learning-to-rank methods that attempt to optimize NDCG or MAP approximate such measures so that they can be differentiable. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective stochastic optimization algorithm to directly minimize any loss function, which can be defined on NDCG or MAP for the learning-to-rank problem. The algorithm employs Simulated Annealing along with Simplex method for its parameter search and finds the global optimal parameters. Experiment results using NDCG-Annealing algorithm, an instance of the proposed algorithm, on LETOR benchmark data sets show that the proposed algorithm is both effective and stable when compared to the baselines provided in LETOR 3.0. In addition, we applied the algorithm for ranking ads in contextual advertising. Our method has shown to significantly improve relevance in offline evaluation and business metrics in online tests in a real large-scale advertising serving system. To scale our computations, we parallelize the algorithm in a MapReduce framework running on Hadoop."

At each iteration, the worker summarizes its data-partition using histograms. The master processor uses these to build one layer of a regression tree, and then sends this layer to the workers, allowing the workers to build histograms for the next layer.

There are evaluation methods in the literature that use clicks and editorial judgments together, but our approach is novel in the sense that it allows us to predict the impact of unseen search models without online tests to collect clicks and without requesting new editorial data, since we are only re-using existing editorial data, and clicks observed for previous result set configurations. Since the user browsing model and the pre-existing editorial data cannot provide relevance estimates for all documents for the selected set of queries, one important challenge is to obtain this performance estimation where there are a lot of ranked documents with missing relevance values. We introduce a query and rank based smoothing to overcome this problem. We show that a hybrid of these smoothing techniques performs better than both query and position based smoothing, and despite the high percentage of missing judgments, the resulting method is significantly correlated (0.74) with DCG values evaluated using fully judged datasets, and approaches inter-annotator agreement. We show that previously published techniques, applicable to frequent queries, degrade when applied to a random sample of queries, with a correlation of only 0.29. While our experiments focus on evaluation using DCG, our method is also applicable to other commonly used metrics."

Clarke, ","The Maximum Entropy Method provides one technique for validating search engine effectiveness measures. Under this method, the value of an effectiveness measure is used as a constraint to estimate the most likely distribution of relevant documents under a maximum entropy assumption. This inferred distribution may then be compared to the actual distribution to quantify the ""informativeness"" of the measure. The inferred distribution may also be used to estimate values for other effectiveness measures. Previous work focused on traditional effectiveness measures, such as average precision. In this paper, we extend the Maximum Entropy Method to the newer cascade and intent-aware effectiveness measures by considering the dependency of the documents ranked in a results list. These measures are intended to reflect the novelty and diversity of search results in addition to the traditional relevance. Our results indicate that intent-aware measures based on the cascade model are informative in terms of both inferring actual distribution and predicting the values of other retrieval measures."

Work on these algorithms is in part driven by a belief that folksonomies are useful for tasks such as: (a) Navigating social tagging systems and (b) Acquiring semantic relationships between tags. While the promises and pitfalls of the latter have been studied to some extent, we know very little about the extent to which folksonomies are pragmatically useful for navigating social tagging systems. This paper sets out to address this gap by presenting and applying a pragmatic framework for evaluating folksonomies. We model exploratory navigation of a tagging system as decentralized search on a network of tags. Evaluation is based on the fact that the performance of a decentralized search algorithm depends on the quality of the background knowledge used. The key idea of our approach is to use hierarchical structures learned by folksonomy algorithm as background knowledge for decentralized search. Utilizing decentralized search on tag networks in combination with different folksonomies as hierarchical background knowledge allows us to evaluate navigational tasks in social tagging systems. Our experiments with four state-of-the-art folksonomy algorithms on five different social tagging datasets reveal that existing folksonomy algorithms exhibit significant, previously undiscovered, differences with regard to their utility for navigation. Our results are relevant for engineers aiming to improve navigability of social tagging systems and for scientists aiming to evaluate different folksonomy algorithms from a pragmatic perspective."

A typical example is to use ""Canon"" and ""Nikon"" as seed entities, and derive other entities (e.g., ""Olympus"") in the same concept set of camera brands. In order to discover such relevant entities, we exploit several web data sources, including lists extracted from web pages and user queries from a web search engine. While these web data are highly diverse with rich information that usually cover a wide range of the domains of interest, they tend to be very noisy. We observe that previously proposed random walk based approaches do not perform very well on these noisy data sources. Accordingly, we propose a new general framework based on iterative similarity aggregation, and present detailed experimental results to show that, when using general-purpose web data for set expansion, our approach outperforms previous techniques in terms of both precision and recall."

To satisfy this requirement, the Web is frequently crawled. Due to the sheer size of their indexes, search engines distribute the crawled documents among thousands of servers in a scheme called local index-partitioning, such that each server indexes only several million pages. To ensure documents from the same host (e.g., www.nytimes.com) are distributed uniformly over the servers, for load balancing purposes, random routing of documents to servers is common. To expedite the time documents become searchable after being crawled, documents may be simply appended to the existing index partitions. However, indexing by merely appending documents, results in larger index sizes since document reordering for index compactness is no longer performed. This, in turn, degrades search query processing performance which depends heavily on index sizes."

Such networks play an increasingly important role in reviewing websites such as Epinions.com or online sharing websites like Flickr.com. In this paper, we first observe and analyze the temporal behavior of users in a social rating network, who express ratings and create social relations. Then, we model the temporal dynamics of an SRN based on our observations, using the bidirectional effects of ratings and social relations. While existing models for other types of social networks have captured some of the effects, our model is the first one to represent all four effects, i.e. social relations-on-ratings (social influence), social relations-on-social relations (transitivity), ratings-on-social relations (selection), and ratings-on-ratings (correlational influence). Existing works consider these effects as static and constant throughout the evolution of an SRN, however our observations reveal that these effects are actually dynamic. We propose a probabilistic generative model for SRNs, which models the strength and dynamics of each effect throughout the network evolution. This model can serve for the prediction of future links, ratings or community structures. Due to the sensitive nature of SRNs, another motivation for our work is the generation of synthetic SRN data sets for research purposes. Our experimental studies on two real life datasets (Epinions and Flickr) demonstrate that the proposed model produces social rating networks that agree with real world data on a comprehensive set of evaluation criteria."

We propose a framework that exploits homophily to establish an integrated network linking a user to interested services and connecting different users with common interests, upon which both friendship and interests could be efficiently propagated. The proposed friendship-interest propagation (FIP) framework devises a factor-based random walk model to explain friendship connections, and simultaneously it uses a coupled latent factor model to uncover interest interactions. We discuss the flexibility of the framework in the choices of loss objectives and regularization penalties and benchmark different variants on the Yahoo! Pulse social networking system. Experiments demonstrate that by coupling friendship with interest, FIP achieves much higher performance on both interest targeting and friendship prediction than systems using only one source of information."

We explain these phenomena by showing that there are economic and social factors that lenders take into account when deciding to bid on a listing. We also observe that the profits the lenders make are tied with their bidding preferences. Finally, we build a model based on the temporal progression of the bidding, that reliably predicts the success of a loan request listing, as well as whether a loan will be paid back or not."

In this paper, we define a measure of hierarchy in a directed online social network, and present an efficient algorithm to compute this measure. We validate our measure using ground truth including Wikipedia notability score. We use this measure to study hierarchy in several directed online social networks including Twitter, Delicious, YouTube, Flickr, LiveJournal, and curated lists of several categories of people based on different occupations, and different organizations. Our experiments on different online social networks show how hierarchy emerges as we increase the size of the network. This is in contrast to random graphs, where the hierarchy decreases as the network size increases. Further, we show that the degree of stratification in a network increases very slowly as we increase the size of the graph."

Important usage of such networks includes trust prediction, finding the most reliable or trusted node in a local subgraph, etc. For many of these applications, it is crucial to assess the prestige and bias of a node. The bias of a node denotes its propensity to trust/mistrust its neighbours and is closely related to truthfulness. If a node trusts all its neighbours, its recommendation of another node as trustworthy is less reliable. It is based on the idea that the recommendation of a highly biased node should weigh less. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to compute the bias and prestige of nodes in networks where the edge weight denotes the trust score. Unlike most other graph-based algorithms, our method works even when the edge weights are not necessarily positive. The algorithm is iterative and runs in O(km) time where k is the number of iterations and m is the total number of edges in the network. The algorithm exhibits several other desirable properties. It converges to a unique value very quickly. Also, the error in bias and prestige values at any particular iteration is bounded. Further, experiments show that our model conforms well to social theories such as the balance theory (enemy of a friend is an enemy, etc.)."

Existing methods for K-NNG construction either do not scale, or are specific to certain similarity measures. We present NN-Descent, a simple yet efficient algorithm for approximate K-NNG construction with arbitrary similarity measures. Our method is based on local search, has minimal space overhead and does not rely on any shared global index. Hence, it is especially suitable for large-scale applications where data structures need to be distributed over the network. We have shown with a variety of datasets and similarity measures that the proposed method typically converges to above 90% recall with each point comparing only to several percent of the whole dataset on average."

In this paper, we propose a solution that mixes clusterings and orders, and devise a new algorithm, called Layered Label Propagation, that builds on previous work on scalable clustering and can be used to reorder very large graphs (billions of nodes). Our implementation uses task decomposition to perform aggressively on multi-core architecture, making it possible to reorder graphs of more than 600 millions nodes in a few hours."

For various commercial and sociological purposes, an independent estimate of their sizes is important. In this work, algorithms for estimating the number of users in such networks are considered. The proposed schemes are also applicable for estimating the sizes of networks' sub-populations. The suggested algorithms interact with the social networks via their public APIs only, and rely on no other external information. Due to obvious traffic and privacy concerns, the number of such interactions is severely limited. We therefore focus on minimizing the number of API interactions needed for producing good size estimates. We adopt the abstraction of social networks as undirected graphs and use random node sampling. By counting the number of collisions or non-unique nodes in the sample, we produce a size estimate. Then, we show analytically that the estimate error vanishes with high probability for smaller number of samples than those required by prior-art algorithms. Moreover, although our algorithms are provably correct for any graph, they excel when applied to social network-like graphs. The proposed algorithms were evaluated on synthetic as well real social networks such as Facebook, IMDB, and DBLP. Our experiments corroborated the theoretical results, and demonstrated the effectiveness of the algorithms."

Its computation can be reduced to counting the number of triangles incident on the particular node in the network. In case the graph is too big to fit into memory, this is a non-trivial task, and previous researchers showed how to estimate the clustering coefficient in this scenario. A different avenue of research is to to perform the computation in parallel, spreading it across many machines. In recent years MapReduce has emerged as a de facto programming paradigm for parallel computation on massive data sets. The main focus of this work is to give MapReduce algorithms for counting triangles which we use to compute clustering coefficients."

For traditional uses of this technique, uniform independent sampling of the population is often enough to produce an exposed group that can serve as a statistical proxy for the full population."

The neighbourhood function provides a wealth of information about the graph [10] (e.g., it easily allows one to compute its diameter), but it is very expensive to compute it exactly. Recently, the ANF algorithm [10] (approximate neighbourhood function) has been proposed with the purpose of approximating NG(t) on large graphs. We describe a breakthrough improvement over ANF in terms of speed and scalability. Our algorithm, called HyperANF, uses the new HyperLogLog counters [5] and combines them efficiently through broadword programming [8]; our implementation uses talk decomposition to exploit multi-core parallelism. With HyperANF, for the first time we can compute in a few hours the neighbourhood function of graphs with billions of nodes with a small error and good confidence using a standard workstation."

We approach this problem by rewriting SPARQL queries over the views to equivalent queries over the underlying RDF data, thus avoiding the costs entailed by view materialization and maintenance. We show that SPARQL query rewriting combines the most challenging aspects of rewriting for the relational and XML cases: like the relational case, SPARQL query rewriting requires synthesizing multiple views; like the XML case, the size of the rewritten query is exponential to the size of the query and the views. In this paper, we present the first native query rewriting algorithm for SPARQL. For an input SPARQL query over a set of virtual SPARQL views, the rewritten query resembles a union of conjunctive queries and can be of exponential size. We propose optimizations over the basic rewriting algorithm to (i) minimize each conjunctive query in the union; (ii) eliminate conjunctive queries with empty results from evaluation; and (iii) efficiently prune out big portions of the search space of empty rewritings. The experiments, performed on two RDF stores, show that our algorithms are scalable and independent of the underlying RDF stores. Furthermore, our optimizations have order of magnitude improvements over the basic rewriting algorithm in both the rewriting size and evaluation time."

The problem can be summarized as identifying a subset of individuals that need to be convinced to adopt the competing (or ""good"") campaign so as to minimize the number of people that adopt the ""bad"" campaign at the end of both propagation processes. We show that this optimization problem is NP-hard and provide approximation guarantees for a greedy solution for various definitions of this problem by proving that they are submodular. We experimentally compare the performance of the greedy method to various heuristics. The experiments reveal that in most cases inexpensive heuristics such as degree centrality compare well with the greedy approach. We also study the influence limitation problem in the presence of missing data where the current states of nodes in the network are only known with a certain probability and show that prediction in this setting is a supermodular problem. We propose a prediction algorithm that is based on generating random spanning trees and evaluate the performance of this approach. The experiments reveal that using the prediction algorithm, we are able to tolerate about 90% missing data before the performance of the algorithm starts degrading and even with large amounts of missing data the performance degrades only to 75% of the performance that would be achieved with complete data."

A key problem encountered in such systems is the presence of flashers and obscene content. This problem is especially acute given the presence of underage minors in such systems. This paper presents SafeVchat, a novel solution to the problem of flasher detection that employs an array of image detection algorithms. A key contribution of the paper concerns how the results of the individual detectors are fused together into an overall decision classifying the user as misbehaving or not, based on Dempster-Shafer Theory. The paper introduces a novel, motion-based skin detection method that achieves significantly higher recall and better precision. The proposed methods have been evaluated over real-world data and image traces obtained from Chatroulette.com."

Watts, ","We study several longstanding questions in media communications research, in the context of the microblogging service Twitter, regarding the production, flow, and consumption of information. To do so, we exploit a recently introduced feature of Twitter known as ""lists"" to distinguish between elite users - by which we mean celebrities, bloggers, and representatives of media outlets and other formal organizations - and ordinary users. Based on this classification, we find a striking concentration of attention on Twitter, in that roughly 50% of URLs consumed are generated by just 20K elite users, where the media produces the most information, but celebrities are the most followed. We also find significant homophily within categories: celebrities listen to celebrities, while bloggers listen to bloggers etc; however, bloggers in general rebroadcast more information than the other categories. Next we re-examine the classical ""two-step flow"" theory of communications, finding considerable support for it on Twitter. Third, we find that URLs broadcast by different categories of users or containing different types of content exhibit systematically different lifespans. And finally, we examine the attention paid by the different user categories to different news topics."

This model posits the existence of an ""interest space"" that underlies a social network; we prove that in networks produced by this model, not only do short paths exist among all pairs of nodes but natural local routing algorithms can discover them effectively. Specifically, we show that local routing can discover paths of length O(log2 n) to targets chosen uniformly at random, and paths of length O(1) to targets chosen with probability proportional to their degrees. Experiments on the co-authorship graph derived from DBLP data confirm our theoretical results, and shed light into the power of one step of lookahead in routing algorithms for social networks."

We find that the social and organizational context significantly impacts to whom and how fast people forward information.

In its almost forty years of existence, this theory has been empirically supported exclusively through small-scale or controlled laboratory studies. Here we address this phenomenon in the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly, this setting is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus, challenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its size, but also from the non real-time nature of conversations, from the 140 character length restriction, from the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design that was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such constraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to occur given the constraints of this new environment. To investigate this, we develop a probabilistic framework that can model accommodation and measure its effects. We apply it to a large Twitter conversational dataset specifically developed for this task. This is the first time the hypothesis of linguistic style accommodation has been examined (and verified) in a large scale, real world setting."

In such systems, askers' desire for quick answers is in tension with costs associated with interrupting numerous candidate answerers per question. Supporting users of synchronous social Q&A systems at various points in the question lifecycle (from conception to answer) helps askers make informed decisions about the likelihood of question success and helps answerers face fewer interruptions. For example, predicting that a question will not be well answered may lead the asker to rephrase or retract the question. Similarly, predicting that an answer is not forthcoming during the dialog can prompt system behaviors such as finding other answerers to join the conversation. As another example, predictions of asker satisfaction can be assigned to completed conversations and used for later retrieval."

However, the composition is prone to producing semantically conflicting interactions among the services. For example, in an interdepartmental business collaboration through Web services, the decision by the marketing department to clear out the inventory might be inconsistent with the decision by the operations department to increase production. Resolving semantic conflicts is challenging especially when services are loosely coupled and their interactions are not carefully governed. To address this problem, we propose a novel distributed service choreography framework. We deploy safety constraints to prevent conflicting behavior and enforce reliable and efficient service interactions via federated publish/subscribe messaging, along with strategic placement of distributed choreography agents and coordinators to minimize runtime overhead. Experimental results show that our framework prevents semantic conflicts with negligible overhead and scales better than a centralized approach by up to 60%."

Interactions among services involve message exchanges across organizational boundaries in a distributed computing environment, and in order to build such systems in a reliable manner, it is necessary to develop techniques for analyzing such interactions. Choreography conformance involves verifying that a set of services behave according to a given choreography specification that characterizes their interactions. Unfortunately this is an undecidable problem when services interact with asynchronous communication. In this paper we present techniques that identify if the interaction behavior for a set of services remain the same when asynchronous communication is replaced with synchronous communication. This is called the synchronizability problem and determining the synchronizability of a set of services has been an open problem for several years. We solve this problem in this paper. Our results can be used to identify synchronizable services for which choreography conformance can be checked efficiently. Our results on synchronizability are applicable to any software infrastructure that supports message-based interactions."

It allows sending requests asynchronously, without blocking clients from continuing execution. Callback functions are only executed upon receiving the responses. While such mechanism makes browsing a smooth experience, it may cause severe problems in the presence of unexpected network latency, due to the non-determinism of asynchronism. In this paper, we demonstrate the possible problems caused by the asynchronism and propose a static program analysis to automatically detect such bugs in web applications. As client side Ajax code is often wrapped in server-side scripts, we also develop a technique that extracts client-side JavaScript code from server-side scripts. We evaluate our technique on a number of real-world web applications. Our results show that it can effectively identify real bugs. We also discuss possible ways to avoid such bugs."
